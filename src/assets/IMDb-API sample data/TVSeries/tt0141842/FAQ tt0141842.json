      "question": "Is Tony really a sociopath?",
      "answer": "Note well: This is not the opinion of a professional psychiatrist and should be treated as speculation.Repeat viewings of The Sopranos weigh heavily in the direction of Tony being a sociopath. Characteristics of sociopaths that Tony has displayed throughout the series include, but are not limited to, the following.* A lack of empathy for any other Human being, even their own children.* Marked tendency to twist criticisms of their own behaviour into indictments upon others, especially the people criticising them.* Marked tendency to turn conversations about the sufferings of others into conversations about themselves. This is especially apparent during A.J.'s hospital stay in the final season.* A complete lack of regard for the health or wellbeing of others when stacked up to difficulties with their own finances or comfort. (\"Twenty-two hundred a ^%@!ing day...\")Whilst it is true that Doctor Melfi's conduct when \"firing\" Tony seems quite unprofessional, the consensus in the psychiatric community is that unless the sociopath is detected and treated appropriately before puberty, therapy is useless. With Tony's upbringing, he never had a chance.Sociopaths are also noted for low intelligence, and Tony's ability to make choices that only make sense to him is so legendary that one of his closest associates felt a strong urge to throw him into a propeller. Draw your own conclusion."

      "question": "Often when characters are negotiating, they mention \"no-shows\". What does this mean?",
      "answer": "\"No-shows\" are contract jobs, such as construction work, where a person is put on the payroll, with a time card that is clocked in and out for them each day. However, the person never actually shows up to the job. This gives them a steady flow of legitimate income and shows that they are gainfully employed."

      "question": "Will there be a Sopranos movie?",
      "answer": "David Chase has said that he wanted to make a film. But he cannot find a way to properly do the series justice. So until/unless he finds a way; the answer is no. With many of the major characters not surviving the final season and the untimely death of James Gandolfini, it can be assumed a film will never happen now. A prequel film entitiled 'The Many Saints of Newark' was released in 2021. James Gandolfini's real life son Michael Gandolfini plays a teenage Tony Soprano. The film mainly focuses on Tony's mentor and Christopher's father, Dickie Moltisanti and his relationship with the DiMeo crime family of which Tony's father, Johnny and Uncle Junior are members."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are Tony and Christopher related?",
      "answer": "Christopher's father, Dickie Moltisanti was a soldier in Johnny Soprano's crew and was very close to Tony Soprano. Tony reminisces that Dickie was like a big brother to him and so, when Dickie died while Chris was still young, Tony looked out for Chris, affectionately referring to him as his nephew. However, Tony is, technically, not Christopher's uncle. Tony and Carmela Soprano are connected to Chris via three separate family relationships: Christopher's late father, Dickie Moltisanti, was Carmela's first cousin, as Dickie's mother and Carmela's father are siblings. This means Chris is Carmela's first cousin, once removed. Christopher's mother Joanne, whose maiden name is Blundetto, is Al Blundetto's sister. Al Blundetto's wife, Quintina, is Livia Soprano's sister and Tony Soprano's maternal aunt. Thus, Al and Quintina Blundetto, who are Tony Blundetto's parents, are uncle and aunt to both Tony Soprano and Chris. Accordingly, Tony Soprano and Chris are both first cousins to Tony Blundetto, but not to each other. Adriana told her FBI handler Robyn Sanseverino. that technically Christopher and Tony are cousins. Christopher's mother Joanne Blundetto is Tony's maternal cousin via a distant blood relation when the family was still in Italy. Tony confirmed this when he named Christopher his successor and said Christopher would bring the family into the 21st century saying Paulie and Silvio \"aren't my blood\"."

      "question": "What are the lyrics to the theme song?",

But you were born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eye And you woke up this morning, and all that love had gone. Your papa never told you about right and wrong. But you lookin' good baby I believe that you're feelin' fine, shame about it. Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eye so sing it now Woke up this morning.

      "question": "Season 3: What happened to Valery?",
      "answer": "Nobody knows what happened to in . He is never heard from again.Many people believe that he is dead. Being in pajamas with a bullet wound to the head in the freezing cold wouldn't have a favourable outcome for anyone, even a hardcore military expert as the Russian apparently was. He could have covered enough ground to get away from Paulie and Chris from finding him and known how to cover his tracks and lose them. Then again, given that Paulie's car disappeared, so it is possible that the Russian took it and drove himself to safety.However Valery is mentioned at least twice again in passing. None of Tonys crew have any answers as to where he could have got to. It seems safe to assume that as there is no reprisal that he must have died, or at the very least never got involved with gangster life again.--There are subtle clues in the direction of the episode that may indicate Valery's final whereabouts:The opening shot in the woods sequence is a panning shot looking up at trees as the snow falls. This is then revealed to be Valery's POV as he is being marched to his burial spot by Paulie and Christopher, indicating he is examining the trees for some purpose. Then, after Valery is shot, Paulie and Christopher run to the spot where they believe they will find him. At one point the camera films from high above in the trees, looking down on them. This shot may be a second POV shot from Valery's perspective, indicating he climbed into a tree immediately after being shot and watched them below. Because he is never heard from again, it is safe to assume Valery either died in the tree or shortly thereafter and never made it out of the woods to notify Slava of his ordeal. Edit"

      "question": "When does Tony officially become Boss?",
      "answer": "Tony never officially becomes the boss of the Soprano-DiMeo family.Ercole \"Eckley\" DiMeo is the official titled boss of the family, but he is elderly and serving a lifetime sentence in a federal prison, and exerts no influence over the family. DiMeo is never seen onscreen throughout the series, but he is mentioned a handful of times. In the very first episode, Jackie Aprile, Sr. has had the title of Acting Boss for several years, and this title is recognized by New York. However, several characters mention that Tony has actually been managing the day-to-day affairs of the family because Jackie is dying of cancer.After Jackie dies, Uncle Junior receives the official title of acting boss (after Tony gets the other capos to agree to position Junior to take the hits from the feds while Tony secretly calls the shots). At this point, Tony is still technically only a capo. When Junior finds out about Tony's betrayal, it sparks a mob war, which Junior definitively loses. As part of the peace settlement, Junior is allowed to keep his title, while Tony takes on the unofficial (but openly acknowledged) title of street boss.There is no indication that this arrangement changes throughout the series run; even after Junior shoots Tony and is confined to a psychiatric ward, no reference is made to Junior being stripped of his title, and Tony is never mentioned to have been officially promoted.In the season one finale it is said that Tony will be the new boss. Also in the season 2 opener it is said that he is already boss. There however is no official meeting, it is just outright stated. Also in episode 3 of season 2, Junior is told that he gets to \"Keep his Stripes\" but that Tony is the boss."

      "question": "What happens to Tony in the last scene of the series?",
      "answer": "This question has been debated in great length, but there is no clear answer. However, Chase has been quoted as saying everything we need to understand the ending is in the episode itself. He has stated that we are too spoon-fed as an audience, as in tell them what they're going to see, show it to them, then tell them what they've just seen. Chase felt upset that fans seemed to want a bloody death for Tony after cheering him on for 8 years.There are several clues in indicating that Tony was killed:* The previous episode contains a flashback to a scene from Soprano Home Movies (2007) in which and discuss what it's like being killed, saying \"in our line of work, it's always out there. You probably don't even hear it when it happens\". While the flashback may or may not be referring to this scene, the cut to black and complete silence would be exactly what Bobby described.*Chase sets up a pattern of point of view shots where we see a shot of Tony, then his point of view of someone walking into the restaurant when the bell on the door rings, and then the reaction shot. Following this pattern, we hear the bell ring as Meadow opens the door, we get the shot of Tony, then right when we should see Meadow walking in from Tony's point of view, we get black nothingness.* The screen abruptly cuts to black and all sound mutes as opposed to the fade in most other episodes that keeps the soundtrack running (which goes hand in hand with the above-mentioned discussion).* The person staring at and walking to the bathroom is significant enough to be credited, with a special mention to his \"Members Only\" jacket. \"Members Only\" is the episode in which Tony got shot, and is a reference to being in the mob, as well as to the character in \"Members Only\" who kills himself when Tony won't let him move his family to Florida. The \"Members Only\" man simply can be seen to represent everyone Tony has wronged throughout his life. He is also the only patron we see walking into the diner before we get Tony's point of view of him walking into the diner followed by AJ.* A hitman walking into a bathroom to retrieve his weapon reminds of a famous scene from The Godfather.* It's the only time in the series Tony is seen peeling an orange, an obvious reference to the Godfather movies where oranges are closely associated with an approaching death or being shot.* The scene has been edited in a way that builds up tension, which naturally leads the audience on to believe something momentous is going to happen (which may or may not be the case).* Many of the patrons in the diner represent an event from previous episodes that involved killing someone.* Often spoken of in Soprano Home Movies, All Debts Public and Private, and The Happy Wanderer, that there are only two ways out for a boss: dead or in jail. We saw Johnny Sack, another boss, go the route going to jail. We also saw Little Carmine step away from the title of Boss to enjoy and live his life. So it would make sense that we see Tony take the other path, death.However, there are also several things hinting that nothing happened to Tony:* We never actually see anything happen other than suggestive editing - we don't even see a gun. Or to put it more simply, we do not see Tony die, therefore when the show ended, he was still alive.* The lyrics of the infamous Journey song indicate that life goes on despite all the trouble.* The jacket of the Members Only guy doesn't have a logo on it. Maybe that means that he - like the jacket - is an imitation, not the real thing.* There was no reason for Tony to be killed - the hit on Phil had been sanctioned by the Lupertazzi Family. (even so this is debatable because there where many variables in the way the hit went down. Phil was killed in front of his family and other witnesses and his head got crushed by his own SUV. This method of killing may have angered the Lupertazzi Family prompting a possible violent retaliation.)The general consensus that most people can agree with is that the last scene shows the audience how is feeling every day: in an everyday situation like eating dinner, everybody around him could be out to kill him. He is constantly living in paranoia and the fear that anybody who looks at him or brushes past him could be a killer. Whenever anybody enters the diner, looks up to glances up to see if that person is a threat. The last season has had an emphasis on the downside of the mob life - Johnny Sack dying in prison with no money, leaving his widow penniless, people even in high ranks getting killed, killing his own nephew in a despicable way. The final scene shows the sad life of those who survive - living in constant fear, facing death or prison. Edit"
