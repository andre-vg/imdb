      "content": "I can't believe that it took me this long to get around to seeing \"The Sopranos\". I had heard a lot about it, but I can affirm that with this show, \"Six Feet Under\" and \"Game of Thrones\", HBO revolutionized TV in the 21st century. A gritty look at a mob boss and how he tries to balance his work life and family, this show pulls no punches. One of the points that it makes is that there aren't really any \"good\" or \"bad\" characters. People do what they think best serves the family.I don't know if I would go so far as to call it the greatest show ever - my personal fave of HBO's series is \"Six Feet Under\" - but the writing, acting and direction combine to make something that you won't get on the networks or basic cable. If you want to understand some of the best that TV can provide, then you owe it to yourself to watch \"The Sopranos\". Great show.Too bad that James Gandolfini, Nancy Marchand and the recently deceased Frank Vincent are no longer with us."

The entire cast is perfect for their roles, especially James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano. If it winning a million awards isn't enough for you to watch it then all you have to do is read through all the reviews to see how people feel about it. So, if you're one of the few people who hasn't seen this incredible show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as you can. I promise you won't be disappointed!"

Great acting, excellent music, intriguing storylines, and even hilarious situations are combined with HBO's no-holds-barred content. James Gandolfini is mesmerizing as Tony Soprano, a lynchpin in the Italian Mafia. However, instead of seeing Tony as just a one-dimensional thug, we see that he has a life outside of his criminal activities, and that's what makes this show different from it's competition. It's a different side to the story of criminals, that they have normal lives when not breaking the law. The entire supporting cast is brilliant, especially Edie Falco, as Tony's wife Carmela, a deeply religious woman who stands behind her man despite all of his sins and Lorraine Bracco, as Dr. Jennifer Merlhi, Tony's psychiatrist; a woman who fears him when she is giving him therapy, but secretly is attracted to him when they're apart. This is indeed \"the show that revolutionized T.V.\" See it!!!"

      "title": "Consistent in being great",
      "content": "When everyone is telling you how great a show is, it is possible to expect too much. Not in this case. While both subtle and sublime, it also is very violent at times. And while it was playing at HBO and therefor was allowed to do anything it liked to do (nudity and violence/blood), it never did anything just because it could do it. If you had bare breasts, it was at a strip club. If there was violence it occasionally lingered upon it, but sometimes cut away from it too.But let's get to where the show is great: It's acting cast. I had seen quite a few movies with James Gandolfini, but it's a real eye opener seeing him as Tony Soprano. He uses a special \"voice\", that he made up for the character. And it suits him and the story. The show as it is, is trying not to judge too much. It leaves quite a lot of things open for interpretation. It does ground the Gangsters into reality, but it also lets you know that, there is more to some of them than meets the eye.Of course the charismatic portrayal by Gandolfini might lead to impressions that were not entirely intended (just as Pacinos Scarface wasn't meant to be an idol either). But you can't fault the actor or the filmmakers for conclusions other people reach about their creation.Having said that, the first season did seem a bit dated decorations wise, when looked upon in 2011 or '12 for that matter. But it does not take anything away from the show. And while I will still state that \"West Wing\" is my favorite TV show (the first 4 seasons were superior, the latter 3 not as good), the Sopranos is consistently good throughout it's 6(.5) seasons! Another great thing about the show is, that it builds upon the story it set out. So there are strands of the story that will be explored later. But as in real life, some things might go unnoticed forever. You never know with the Sopranos what i's going to be. And it's a very good thing.I drew my own conclusions concerning the ending, but I'm sure there other interpretations out there .. and the ending couldn't have been anything else. It just couldn't!"

We wouldn't have shows like Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul if it weren't for The Sopranos. Though there are arcs, most of the time it's just the daily life of these characters. In particular, Tony Soprano. James Gandolfini delivered one of the best performances of all time. May he Rest In Peace. This show is very divisive when it comes to the ending. Personally, I thought it was brilliant. It made so much sense. It was admittedly cruel yet dedicated to it's themes. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a self-proclaimed lover of cinema, or television."

      "content": "Actually watched 'The Sopranos' for the first time just before the final season was about to end, when at the age where watching 15 plus certificate films and shows was allowed. It left a big impression on me even then, back when my knowledge of film and such was actually pretty limited (am still learning). Especially for the very much missed James Gandolfini, the unyielding storytelling (if by late teens standard a little too much at times) and the complexity of the writing.'The Sopranos' is often on lists of the greatest shows ever made and one of the few to be near-universally acclaimed everywhere, and it is a distinction that is richly deserved. It really is that masterful and it not only is every bit as wonderful as remembered but also even better, due to understanding more of the material and themes and appreciating uncompromising approaches to tough subjects a lot more. Watching 'The Sopranos' feels so much more than watching a television show, it's like watching an epic grand opera and there is really not much to add to what has already been said.Gandolfini plays an enormous part in what makes 'The Sopranos' so brilliant. He is absolutely masterful as one of the most iconic and most complex TV characters to have ever existed, full of chilling intensity but also equally powerful nuance. All the cast are fabulous in their fascinatingly written, compellingly real roles as well, coming over as real people with strengths and flaws and not caricatures. The chemistry scintillates throughout between the whole cast, every emotion in all the universal and relatable issues covered embodied.Writing is also of exceptionally high quality, very hard boiled with a lot of gritty edge but with enough subtlety to avoid heavy handedness. It never felt soap operatic or heavy in melodrama, and the crackling energy of it and the amount of thought probing and emotional complexity there is is non stop. The storytelling is consistently transfixing in one of the few shows to exist to not have a bad season or an episode that disgraces the show, faltering only a little with the abrupt feeling latter stages of the final episode which was not enough to ruin what was absolute perfection up to then. The atmosphere never holds back and hits hard while not being in your face or gratuitous, nothing feels glamourised or sugar-coated.Production values are tremendously stylish and cinematic worthy, while the music fits beautifully throughout. Direction is pacey and tight, while sympathetic enough in more intimate parts.Summing up, one of the greatest shows ever made and a work of art. One of the easiest 10/10s given so far this year."

      "content": "The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or first rate performances.Across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and The Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony.The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever.The true genius of this tale however, is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minute long dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love, honour and respect for family. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama. Forget Family Redifined. This is Television Redifined."

This show dared to go where no TV and not many movies had gone before. It actually portrayed the players in the criminal life as complex human beings and made them relatable.The Godfather and Scroreses works are all fantastic, but Sopranos truly broke new ground in not romantisicing the inner playings of the mafia in any way.The actors are all fantastic, especially the late James Gandolfini, and do a great job of conveying this unique and never-before seen story.Whilst being great in its own right, it paved the way for pretty much all great TV shows since and HBO shows such as Game of Thrones, The Wire, Treme, Rome, The Outsider and so on.It is definitely a recommendation any day of the week if you haven't (for unlikely reasons) watched it yet!"

The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time. James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying, loving upper-middle class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious, greying consiglieri who is often very funny. While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi, and to an extent this is undeniable, I can see so many positives from the show. The portrayal of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore, other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. This is no shallow, dull show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real. The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives, which makes the whole thing more interesting.Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini, for envisioning, television's most complex and enigmatic character. Simply exceptional.10/10"

      "content": "I must to to confess that this is my favorite show. To make review about this is if i quote the movie the \"The Usual Suspects\" \"How do you shoot the Devil in the back? What if you miss?\". I must say right in the beginning that i didn't watch \"Oz\" and \"the Wire\" and maybe they are even batter than \"the sopranos\". It is difficult and complicated to try to explain why it is the best tv show and Probably there will be people that will disagree with me that is the best tv show, it is their opinion and I respect it this is only my point of view and you can disagree with her.The first reason why it is the best tv show is tony soprano- tony soprano, played by James Gandolfini is the \"all American\" guy we can understand his mood it is the daily treble of almost all of us for example treble with the wife treble with the kid at school. It is something that we can sere with him in some level, everybody have the daily treble.Legacy- in 1972, 1974 and 1990 release 4 movies that belong to the gangster genre (the godfather trilogy directed by Francis Ford Coppola and the Goodfellas directed by Martin Scorsese. The sopranos doesn't ignore them but instead she honor them. In the case of the godfather this is by dialogue and even by homage for example the character of Silvio Dante Quoting Scenes from the godfather trilogy, there is scenes that are homage for example in the season 1 2 criminals try to kill tony soprano while he buy and drink orange juice, this is similar to the godfather one when vito buy oranges and 2 people try to kill him. In the case of the Goodfellas two of the main actors play in the Goodfellas Michael Imperioli who play Christopher Moltisanti play the character of spider in the goodfellas and Lorraine Bracco who play Jennifer Melfi play the character of Karen Hill in the goodfellas. Like the godfather there is references in the show to the Goodfellas in dialogue or homage to scene from the movie.Innovation- Like I explain the sopranos honor the Classic gangster movie of the modern era but it also inventive. It is the first time that the gangster sit in the \"The psychologist's desk\" before that the gangster didn't talk about their feeling and what bothering them. Here the gangster have panic attack and he talks with psychologist. The second Innovation is combination of genera it is realistic but sometimes there is formalism scenes.Rewatch- I can watch the show multiple time and each time to Pay attention to different aspect like the Italian culture, psychology, family, mafiathe anti hero- tony soprano has two side. On the one hand the family the quarrel with the wife and the children and the conflict between tony and his mother. On the other hands he is criminal who make terrible thing like Cheat on his wife and murder. Despite all this We still love him because we can identify us in tony soprano sometimes, we all have conflict with the family sometimes we all have thing that are bothering us. Sometimes there is moments that the acting is real I mean it feel like it is not acting for example tony and his son, tony doesn't want his son to \"to walk in his shoes\" and this is touching, a father who want a better life for his son than his experience life.I Probably can find more aspect to talk about like the the mother son Relationship and the Supporting roles but I stop hereI think if you want happy movies or happy tv show the sopranos is not for you. In addition if you have problem with violence and sex don't watch the sopranos, Otherwise go and see the sopranos and check by yourself after all this is just my opinion."

      "title": "Still ahead of its time.",
      "content": "I wasn't into television when the Sopranos first aired seeing as I was only 5 years old then, so I was curious to see whether it would hold up compared to today's standards, but what I found was a series so ahead of its time that it continues to be ahead of its time still to this day.The writing, directing, and performances go without saying - even smaller characters like AJ totally kill it in later seasons, and Meadow becoming increasingly likeable. Again, all thanks to the writing. Edie Falco and James Gandolfini give the performances of a lifetime. Jimmy's performance is often described as 'transcendent' and I think that is the most perfect word to describe it.The ending of this show I've learned was something of a controversy at the time of its airing, which in some ways I can understand, but it is a shame, because those fans who didn't try to understand the ending and resorted to becoming frustrated and hostile missed out on what I believe to be the most perfect ending to a television series to date. I don't believe there is anything to suggest that the ending is ambiguous. There are references throughout the entire finale season, some in previous seasons, and some very not-so-subtle hints there even in the final scene.Existentialism at its finest. A perfect show without a single weak episode. Yes, even the 'happy birthday Mr. President' episode. You know what I'm talking about."

      "title": "What is the life of a mob like?",
      "content": "Rest in peace James Gandolfini, the hero that played Tony Soprano, the protagonist of the series The Sopranos. Tony Soprano along with the New Jersey mob family are going through hard moments every single time, either with police or the New York mob family as we see from the beginning of the show and to be honest, the story felt realistic. I am glad this show inspired a show like Breaking Bad, because The Sopranos, Breaking Bad and The Wire are presenting the mob life the best. I love Tony Soprano and Christopher Moltisanti as characters the most, along with other like Paulie, Silvio, Bobby, Junior, Johnny Sack and many others.My favorite episodes are: Pine Barrens, The Blue Comet and Long Term Parking. The conclusion is also perfect, truly unexpected to be honest, Made in America, the last episode is also a masterpiece of an ending. I recommend this show to everyone, hope you will enjoy it!"

Shows his, er, \"business\" dealings, his family life and everything in between.A monumentally brilliant and influential drama series. There had been crime dramas before, but this transcended that by making the criminals human. We see their personal relationships, anxieties, ups and downs, joys and pains. This is not a crime drama, its a drama, with criminals the main characters.Intelligent, fast-moving plot, snappy, often funny, dialogue and good action scenes. This has it all.This series created the blueprint for future TV dramas and put HBO on the map."

      "title": "The best show of all time",
      "content": "The Sopranos is a TV series that has gained the reputation of being one of the \"greatest TV shows\" of all time, and I think it's a title the series deserves. It's one third of what I like to call the \"holy trinity\" of TV dramas, the other two being the much loved Breaking Bad and the critically acclaimed The Wire. It's such a great TV series that even a 20,000 word review would struggle to explain every single thing about the show that works, and I know you're about as willing to read a post that long as I am willing to write one, so I'll try not to draw this one out too much. That being said, there's a lot about this show that I want to say, and a lot of praise I'd love to throw its way, so here goes.The Sopranos works on so many different levels it's staggering. It's a complex character study, a tense crime drama, a relatable family drama, and sometimes it even feels like a weird, twisted sitcom. There's moments of brutal and shocking realism right alongside surreal dream sequences and scenes ambiguous in nature. There's suspense, black comedy, surprising deaths, and even the odd tear-jerking moment.Every character is fascinating, as barely anyone is purely good or purely evil- almost every character is a different shade of morally ambiguous grey, and this is what makes almost every character, major or minor, so interesting. The stand-out character of course is Tony Soprano; the show is about him after all. He is absolutely flawlessly played by James Gandolfini, who has done other stuff in his career, but never anything as memorable as his role as the lead in The Sopranos. Here is a character who feels like such a real person it's damn near scary- I feel like I know Tony better than some people I see in real life on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. This is perhaps one of the most fleshed-out and well-developed characters in the history of entertainment. Throughout the 6 seasons we see dozens of Tony's therapy sessions, with each one adding something to the character. We see many of his dreams too, with these sequences putting the viewer directly into his head and allowing us to see his most personal thoughts and feelings. He interacts with countless other characters too; in fact, almost every character in the show interacts with Tony on at least one occasion. It's a credit to both Gandolfini and the writers that the character of Tony Soprano felt so real throughout the show's run.That's not to say Tony's the only well-developed character on the show, because that's not true at all. Almost every character has depth and is interesting in their own way- personal favourite characters of mine include Livia Soprano, Tony's delightfully crabby mother who's obsessed with control, Ralph Cifaretto, an absolutely horrible colleague of Tony's who is so much fun to despise, and Adrianna, a character who starts out as being there mainly for fan service, but becomes one of the show's most sympathetic and interesting characters further down the line. I would like to talk more about the characters, but honestly, to do so may cause this review to move into spoiler territory, because like I said before, nobody on this show is ever really safe from death. One character may appear to be the kind of person who'd last all six seasons, but may well be \"whacked\" after just a few episodes. On the other hand, there's characters who could only be seen in the background occasionally throughout the first season who become significant characters in later seasons. What I'm trying to get at is that the show's unpredictable and I don't want to go into discussing specific plot-lines or characters too much because you're really better off going into this series knowing as little as possible in order to get the most enjoyment out of it.And by the way, try not to read too much about the show on the internet either before or while you're watching it, as it's an old-ish show, and that means people are generally less cautious about displaying spoiler warnings prior to discussing potentially \"sensitive\" material. The internet is a dangerous place to be while you're watching a show that's already aired, so just remember to be cautious.The use of music in this show is also something that really needs mentioning. The show uses music frequently, and also uses a great range of music throughout its run. David Chase and the others who worked on the show clearly have a talent for selecting music that just works so well for particular moments. Special mention has to go to a few songs/scenes in particular: Alabama 3's \"Woke up This Morning,\" which is used so perfectly in the show's unforgettable opening sequence, which never fails to get me psyched for the episode to follow.A lesser-known Rolling Stones song called \"Thru and Thru\" is used unbelievably well in the final montage of seasons 2's finale, \"Fun-house.\" (\"Fun\" fact: Funhouse is not only my favourite episode of The Sopranos but probably my favourite TV episode of all time. I think it's so good I might even write a blog post specifically for the episode, as I can't really go into why it's so good in this review without outlining the general plot-line).Then there's the song \"Wrapped in my Memory\" by Shawn Smith used at the end of the classic episode \"Long-term Parking,\" which is season 5's penultimate episode. The way this bittersweet sounding song is used is phenomenal- a perfect way to end one of the most well-known episodes of the showAnd I don't want to forget the use of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" in the show's notorious final scene. Most people seem to associate the song with Glee, but The Sopranos used it first, and so much better too. Like the episode Funhouse, the final scene of The Sopranos could use its own blog post also, but I probably won't ever talk about it because it's already been discussed to death all over the internet. Generally every episode of The Sopranos ends with a piece of music that plays over the final scene, and continues to play over the credits, and it's staggering how often this piece of music reflects either the style, tone, themes, or even the general plot of the episode it closes. I'm an absolute sucker for a good soundtrack, and The Sopranos, I'm pleased to say, completely nails it in the music department.The writing and the directing in The Sopranos is sharp as hell too. The writer's inject so much wit, tension, and pathos into this show (sometimes all at once) it's mind-blowing. The show has so many different moods and feelings, but somehow the writers manage to tie it altogether into something that feels very cohesive. Many, many quotable lines and catchphrases too. This show has some serious style too, and the look and feel of the show honestly looks almost movie-quality at times. This can be credited to the show's directors and cinematographers, who give the show such a unique and memorable style that really progresses and becomes more pronounced as the show goes on. There's a reason this show was so revolutionary and acclaimed when it first came out- no other show before it had ever looked quite so cinematic. I personally found myself forgetting at times that I was watching a TV show (worth mentioning is that the acting from some cast members is movie-quality too).Mind you, The Sopranos is not a show for everyone. It's got some very adult content, and there's the fact that it's quite a strange show too- there's literally at least three episodes that are almost 45 minute long dream sequences inside Tony's head, and a sense of ambiguity is often present thanks to the characters' general sense of moral murkiness, as well as their often strange and ambiguous motivations that aren't always spelled out. Almost no character is ever easy to decipher and understand- there's few stereotypes on this show- and while this could frustrate some people, I personally like this aspect of the show, as it makes everyone feel a bit more \"real\" and compelling. And then there's that ending, which isn't going to be for everyone (I loved it though).I also want to say that this show requires some patience to really get into. I don't think the first season was phenomenal, as the writers and cast members were still trying to work out the best way to portray and develop these characters, so it gets off to a slightly shaky and uncertain start. Mind you, I still thought the first season was very good, but it took me to the end of the second season before I started loving the show, and it was about a month after I finished the final season before I realised that The Sopranos was probably my all-time favourite show. The show will grow on you, but it'll probably take some time, so be patient. Pretty much every HBO show is like this (see Game of Thrones and The Wire in particular). Also, there are a huge number of characters, and it will take by my approximation at least 10 episodes before you'll remember most of their names (unless you've got a great memory or something). This can make early episodes a little difficult to get through, but if you stick with it it'll become something you get used to.So if you're an avid TV watcher, I highly recommend giving The Sopranos a watch. It helped popularise the sense of grey VS grey morality that is so prevalent many recent shows, and also pushed many boundaries in regards to what kind of adult content a TV show could depict, as well as how cinematic TV could look. It's amazingly well acted, written, and directed, has an astoundingly diverse soundtrack, and features in my personal opinion one of the most deep and interesting characters off all-time- Tony Soprano. I see it as required viewing, and even though you personally may not love every aspect of it, I'm sure most of you will be at least able to develop a great sense of respect for the show. Don't be put off by its age, or the fact it ended 13 years ago- this is still must-watch television that has aged and will continue to age gracefully."

Gandolfini deserves all the praise coming his way. (His monolouge as a hitman describing his first \"hit\" in True Romance is a great piece of work). Bravo!!"

      "title": "Greatest writing of all time 10/10",
      "content": "The Sopranos is known for many things: its classic scenes, characters, quotes, gabagool, the dream sequences, etc.One thing in particular it is known for amongst many viewers and critics is the writing. The script written in such a perfect and absolute genius way that made me smile and be amazed while watching.What I was intrigued/captivated by the most, same as everyone else was Tony Soprano's arc. His character is among the best written along side Walter white and Gustavo Fring from \"Breaking Bad\". You see his character for 6 seasons going to therapy and trying to be a better person, trying to change. Yet in the end he stays the same guy as we saw him in the first episode. There is a monolog of his at the end of season 1 how he reflects on himself and coming to terms with his attitude and behavior towards everyone. This is shown and reflected many times throughout the show until the very end. Because his character never changes, so does the story has nowhere to go. Leading me to believe what happened to Tony in the famous ending of the show.The Sopranos, centers around a mobster going to therapy in order to deal with his past - while reading those lines, it seems like a simple premise. As much as we the audience dive deeper into the layers of the story we see it's all about a man willing to change and failing.Same type of arc we see with Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperoli). His character is depicted as a man with high hopes and expectations, he tries to rise up in ranks and be a well man in the family, But in the end his downfall into drugs is tragic, thus making it more good for a character's arc.Amongst all the characters I enjoyed during the series, my favorites were Tony Soprano (the GOAT James Gandolfini), Christopher and Paulie Walnuts (Tony Sirico). Each and every of the other characters has more layers and depth to add to the story and events.Along with the huge amount of humor put in this show, the series focuses on many aspects in social life, many subjects you may think of later on. The elements of family, faith, respect, betrayal and nation portray a big role on the show, while other subjects such as discrimination, racism, illness, psychiatry and nostalgia to old times come often as motives.Throughout the show there are many characters who rise and fall, leaving Tony to either call the shots or take matters into his own hands. At the end he's all alone with the decision. As much as he was a character I loved, he also was a guy I wanted to dislike and not empathize with. Of course there were moments where I did empathize with him, such as whenever he was in pain and agony. I know it sounds weird but it's a type of situation where you say: \"I feel sorry for you, yet you deserved it\".Tony's character seems to never change throughout his story arc, which may hint to his death in the final scene of the show.I won't go into details on how and why Tony is infact dead, there are many great analysis over the sequence, just read creator David Chase's quote about the sequence and you'll find the answer - \"it's all there\".In conclusion, The Sopranos is and forever will be the greatest written show, rather I feel like it or everyone does. Television wouldn't have been the same without the odd, redefined family, and many shows from then on moved to follow its steps in terms of screenwriting and character's arc."
