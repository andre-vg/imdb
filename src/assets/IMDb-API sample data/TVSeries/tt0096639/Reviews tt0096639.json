      "content": "This six-hour television mini-series was as good as advertised, which is saying a lot. I don't prefer long movies but this is very watchable. It's such an interesting story and so-well photographed that you don't mind the long length.The acting is top-rate, led by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, with a deep cast that includes many well-known actors. As a male, I really enjoyed ogling Diane Lane and I've always liked Glenne Headley, too, although more for her voice.Fredric Forest is absolutely brutal as the half-breed killer, one of the most unremorseful murderers I've even seen on film. Angelica Huston, Rick Schroeder, Danny Glover, Robert Urtich, D. B. Sweeney and Steve Buscemi all were superb, too.The story has a great mix of drama, romance, action, sadness and just plain realism. The characters are bold and unrelenting and you find yourself getting wrapped up in this story and with these people, what they went through. It's just great storytelling but - as in real life - it isn't all roses; there's a lot of sadness here."

      "title": "Ambitious, close-to-legendary TV epic based on Larry McMurtrey's sprawling, episodic novel, a worthy cousin to \"Giant.\"",
      "content": "Little did I realize when I picked up the videotape of `Lonesome Dove' that I would be pitching a tent myself, camped out in front of the tube for most of my Saturday (6 hours, not including pauses for bathroom breaks, meals, letting the dog out, etc.). It certainly rearranged all my weekend priorities, but it was well worth the sacrifice after all the hoopola I've heard regarding this movie. It is a must experience.Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones top-line an outstanding cast in this epic-proportioned western which should have been worthy of a cinematic release for it captures beautifully the look, the feel and the time of the Old West as never before.In a nutshell, it relates the tale of two former Texas Rangers, Woodrow Call (Jones) and Gus McCrae (Duvall), both getting on in years, who manage a dusty but comfortable living running a cattle company just outside rundown Lonesome Dove, Texas. A third ranger, Jake Spoon (Robert Urich), returns from up north, on the lam for an accidental murder, and perks Woodrow's interest in being the first to take a herd into the mostly unsettled northern region of Montana, while laying claim to an area considered `perfect cattle territory.' He convinces relaxed old-timer Gus, who is content these days with a bottle of whiskey and a whore, to join him for one last thrill to recapture their old \"Texas Ranger\" glory days and shake up their too sedentary lives.Re-stealing horses and a herd from Mexican bandidos, they sign on a team of men to undertake the arduous journey eventually braving about every type of adversity imaginable. When it's not windstorms and snake-infested waters threatening life, limb and livestock, they have murderous horse thieves and vengeful Indians to contend with.What makes `Lonesome Dove' stand out proudly is not only its rich, panoramic beauty and intriguing story-lines, but its caring, sharply-defineated characters that keep this six-hour plus movie from ever wandering off. These are people you become fascinated with; people that you want to know as much as you can about  even minor characters stay with you here, such as the desponding, thick-accented bar-owner who carries the torch for one of his whores, or the spiritual cook who passes out whittled amulet-like carvings to the cattle team. When asked why he doesn't ride horses, he simply responds, `We are all animals. How would you like it if someone rode on you?'An intricate, finely-tuned subplot weaves in and out of the main Woodrow/Gus narrative. A northern sheriff July Johnson (Chris Cooper), accompanied by his stepson, reluctantly takes off to Texas after Jake Spoon for the accidental murder of the town's mayor, but gets sidetracked halfway when he learns his new wife Elmira (Glenne Headley) has abandoned him and the boy in her obsession to find the no-account man she left behind.The acting is superb all around, especially by those mentioned above. They give this movie such heart and scope. Also contributing greatly are Diane Lane as the town whore who seeks a better life; earnest Ricky Schroeder as the youngest member of the team whose family tree is questioned; Danny Glover, the wise and dedicated team scout; Barry Corbin as the slow-thinking undersheriff; Frederic Forrest as the murderous redskin Blue Duck; Angelica Huston as Duvall's kind-hearted former flame; Steve Buscemi and Frederick Coffin as a pair of lusty lowlifes; Nina Siemaszko as a scrappy backwoods waif, and others too numerous to name. But Tommy Lee Jones and, especially, Robert Duvall are the heart and soul of this piece. They limn characters so fascinating and complete, they just stand apart from the rest. Gus McCrae, in particular, will be remembered as one of Duvall's proudest creations.So, if you are into all-day campouts that will make you feel you yourself have been on a trek, `Lonesome Dove' is your ticket. It is wondrous entertainment that now lies in the miniseries Hall of Fame along with \"Roots.\""

      "content": "As a boy, I never liked western films. My father loved them all, all the John Wayne classics, the Spaghetti Westerns, the whole lot.I despised them all. They were all the same. Same plot. Same rotten cinematography. Same unbelievable characters. Couldn't understand the attraction.Then I saw Lonesome Dove. This film (actually a mini-series) is an absolute masterpiece.It starts with the cinematography and locations. It was not your stereotypical Utah-canyon photography, it was the great plains, the Texas deserts, the wide rivers, the mesquite groves. Not marvelous vistas, but simple, real, gritty scenery. You can taste the dust of the panhandle and smell the Kansas plains.Then there's the action. There's lots of it. Flooding rivers, driving rains, realistic fights, thundering cattle drives, horrible scenes of rape and torture (just under TV censor radar), plenty of death and sadness. All of it believable. All of it heart-tugging. All of it amazing.But above all of these great features are the characters and the writing. Augustus McCrae and Woodrow F. Call have become two icons of pop culture, polar opposites who work well together and, in the end, are incomplete without one another. The supporting cast as well is fabulous, well written, patently interesting, and tremendously played. Even the evil characters are fascinating.This is what television and film should be. It is very, very rare for anything of this quality to ever appear on the small screen, and with today's \"reality TV\" craze, it is even rarer still.Buy the DVD set. You won't be disappointed. 10 out of 10. Barky"

He makes this film for me and I was really happy to hear that it was Duval's favorite character out of his long, excellent career. Lonesome Dove, which is so brilliant, should be on the list of anyone who likes westerns, and anyone who likes good filmmaking in general!"

Twelve solid hours! And I had other things to do, too!\"It's that good!How in the world did they do it? How did they fight off the \"helpful\" execs who must have told them things like: \"NO NO NO!. Cowboys never wore hats like that, or carried guns like that. And why don't you shoot it in places with more spectacular scenery, like the National Parks? And why do you insist on taking all that time introducing the characters? And why isn't there more quick draws and fancy gunplay? And how come the good guys don't triumph in the end? And you can't just kill off sympathetic characters like that! Haven't you people ever seen a western movie? YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT THIS WAY!\" But by some miracle, they could, and did.The fact that Gus and Call ride past the Alamo WITHOUT SAYING A SINGLE WORD ABOUT IT, just stunned me!Top notch everything! Go anywhere in it, pause it, turn off the color and feast your eyes on the most convincing presentation of the West as it appeared in the 1870s you'll ever see outside a museum.I am in awe of this masterpiece. Don't rent it, BUY IT."

Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are nearly perfect. Duvall has been quoted as saying that Gus McCrae was his favorite character he ever played. He is certainly mine. Angelica Huston is the perfect person to play Clara. It is almost like Larry McMurtry had some of these actors and actresses in mind when he wrote his novel. The only exception is Frederic Forrest as Blue Duck. He does a fine job with what he's got, but the man just isn't big enough or scary enough for this role. The story is incredible. The scenery is beautiful. Lonesome Dove is, in my opinion, the best western ever made. A definite must see for everyone."

Every detail was as if it was 1880...including dialogue, character depth...and the utter chaos and randomness of life.While there are a couple special effects that might have been a little better, this work of art adds to life. When you have a block of time, watch it."

      "title": "This is the finest Western film ever made, bar none.",
      "content": "The Lonesome Dove mini-series contains every core element of a classic story of the mythic Old West: romance, tragedy, courageous and independent yet very human heroes, vicious yet believable villains, plenty of action, and the overall grit and determination of frontier life. These elements are all woven into an enthralling story centered on an epic journey across the American frontier--a cattle drive from Texas to Montana undertaken shortly after the Custer massacre. The movie is extremely faithful (in plot, dialogue, and characterizations) to the excellent novel by Larry McMurtry, and especially benefits from McMurtry's genius at narrative and story construction. What makes the film even better are the truly exceptional performances by the first rate cast, that includes Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Ulrich, and Anjelica Huston, and the great musical score, which won a well-deserved Emmy. This is the kind of film about the Old West that only comes along once in a blue moon, and lovers of Old West stories and movies (as well as real-life cowboys) watch it over and over. In my view, it ranks above even the classics of Western film, including Red River, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and Shane--and I love all of those films. Even though it is over six hours long, and technically a TV mini-series, it should be considered a great film."

      "content": "Lonesome Dove tells the story of friendship, love, tragedy, life, change, the frontier, the passing of generations.Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call are retired Texan Rangers, holed up in the small, dusty south Texas town of Lonesome Dove, a town with less going on than the nearby Rio Grande. Some prodding by a former partner gets them off their front porch and up in the saddle again, guiding a herd of cattle and of horses, a passle of men, a boy, and a lady of the night. They off and go to Montana, along the way meeting death, life, former loves and new loves, and witnessing the closing of the American frontier.This film is six hours long, if you think of things that way, but really, it's far too short. You want to stop the film and get on your own horse to ride along with Gus and Woodrow. Yeah, it would be tough, but you know that Gus and Woodrow would be faithful friend who'd have the gumption to tell you the truth, even if it hurt a bit or a lot.You'd miss a lot if you think of this film as simply a `show' or even entertainment. It captures your imagination, and helps you see what life was like 120 years ago - in some cases nasty, brutish, and short, but in other cases full of love, wonder, tenderness, compassion, and hope. The film doesn't dwell on the gore, but it doesn't hide it. Life on the frontier was tough, wearing on the body and mind, and relentlessly unforgiving of the weak, mistaken, and mislead. You -died- on the frontier, and death wasn't always easy. But along the way you live in breathtaking beauty. You get to see the world your hands make - you build your life from the dirt on the ground and the trees on the hill.Gus and Woodrow ARE Texas Rangers, two men as different from each other as can be. Gus enjoys life, and seeks to chase buffalo just for the fun of it. Woodrow sees life as something to fight, to prepare for its certain triumph, but still manages to be a loyal, faithful, and loving friend. They interact with each other and the grand sweep of people along the way to Montana.As far as performances, Robert Duvall is an American treasure. I've seen him in many movies, but never knew he was Augustus McCrae until I watched this show. There are just some roles that are designed to fit a particular character. Tommy Lee Jones is cryptic, laconic, guarded, and yet completely tender. You believe he believes he's tough, and you know he knows he's not. Ricky Schroeder plays Newt, Woodrow's unacknowledged son. Diana Lane is Lorena, the 'lady of the night,' and does a good job with her limited role. Anjelica Huston is fine - but of the main players, she's the one I had the least empathy with, mostly because in her other roles she plays someone with a darker and richer voice - in this show she is a tight-voiced soprano with a twang. Had I not seen her in shows, I think I would have believed her better. Chris Cooper plays the dithering sheriff who grows up a bit through the film; his wife, played by Glenne Headley, is very guarded in whom she loves, and it's not Chris Cooper. Robert Urich is Jake, the former saddle-mate of Gus and Woodrow, and Danny Glover is Deets, another partner.Sure, it's a sad film in some ways. Some major players die, and some other players do not rise to the level of their situation. You want to reach in and simply -shake- some of the characters. But they reflect more closely what real people are like, and not so much what people are like when forced to play along with a happy ending.But even with its sadness, it's a film full of life. Gus McCrae simply enjoys- every bit of what he goes through.Get the DVD so you can appreciate the backstory."

Joshua(Danny Glover) is their scout and tracker who joins them on a cattle drive to Montana with another ranger named Jake(Robert Urich),who is on the run after shooting a dentist in a barroom brawl. Along with them is a prostitute, Lorie(a young and beautiful Diane Lane), to make the journey a lot more interesting, especially when Gus repeatedly tells her, Lori, you're just a whore. The dialogue is real, and not your typical western with all good and all bad guys; it is not all black and white in this world, and McMurtry is a genius. The story is a long and all encompassing one, with beautiful scenery from start to finish. It is the best television series ever made, ranking with any theatrical release in its depth and character development. The biggest difference being the length, which provides the time to fully realize the novel. A 10/10."

You can have the Hamlet DVD any day you want; I'll watch Lonesome Dove.Robert Duvall is the anchor and the soul. Name a better performance. Anjelica Huston is the beauty.

Characters converge, separate and reunite later on, the trip fraught with peril, but a deeply moving adventure nonetheless.Captain Augustus McCrae is one of my very favorite literary characters, and Robert Duvall is the ideal casting choice. Same for Tommy Lee Jones; theirs is a curmudgeonly but unbreakable bond. And they're backed by a cast that's pretty much everyone who was working in Hollywood in 1989.If there's a negative to this, it's that the claustrophobic TV aspect ratio doesn't do the vistas justice. But it works wonders in spite of the format's limitations.Good luck keeping a dry eye by series' end.9/10"

People I enjoy sharing my life with. People I'd follow to the ends of the earth if asked. And remembering dear old Gus and Call's journey, is something that brings tears to my eyes. For me... it was real. For me, their friendship was a lighthouse of hope. It was shining the words: \"Never give up on your brothers and sisters, they are your light in the darkness\".To friendship!"

      "content": "By far it is the best western and one of the ONLY westerns I've ever got into. I devoured the book over and over again after I watched the series and am shocked to have the series be just as good as the book, if not better. The cast is a phenomenal cast and Tommy Lee Jone's best performance, I seriously didn't recognize him for a while but when I did I was like THATS Tommy?! That's how good he was! Also Duval and Glover gives an impeccable performance and it is clear that each person playing that character seemed to be MADE to play that person. The women it it give strong performances and the action and music is amazing. A MUST SEE, even if you don't like westerns you'll like this one! I know you will!"

      "content": "I have never really been big on westerns, which I considered Lonesome Dove to be before I saw it. A friend had it and told me I had to see it, I kept her movie for three months before I watched it. When I did though I loved it. I've always loved Tommy Lee Jones but this was his greatest role. Robert Duvall was also fantastic. He makes you fall in love with Gus McCrae. After I saw the movie, now so many times I can quote it, I bought my own copy and read the books. This is by far the best book to movie I have ever seen. Lonesome Dove is a classic whether you like westerns or not."

      "content": "\"Lonesome Dove\" is a unique mini-series, as these sorts of programs were popular in the 1970s and 80s, I cannot recall any of these being westerns. Additionally, many of the typical cliches and plots aren't to be found here in this sprawling six and a half hour movie.The story centers on two main characters.... Gus (Robert Duvall) and Woody (Tommy Lee Jones). These two are lifelong friends, ex-Texas Rangers (the lawmen...not baseball players!) and bachelors and they are different in many ways. Gus is more personable and emotional...and a tough old goat who seems too tough to die. Woody is much quieter and self-controlled....probably too much so. The film follows them from their ranch in South Texas through a cattle drive all the way to their new home in Montana, as Woody heard marvelous things about this part of the country.What you'll enjoy about the film is its long deliberate pace, excellent characters and its scope. But I am forewarning you....don't ever get attached to any of the characters, as through the course of the series, a lot of them die! After all, life is tough...and the film neve shies away from that.By the way, while \"Lonesome Dove\" is a great milestone for television and westerns, it did not receive the Emmy for Best Miniseries....because it had the misfortune of debuting the same year as one of the greatest of all miniseries....\"War and Remembrance\". I can't say I blame them for picking this incredibly good WWII saga...but it's a shame both series couldn't have been recognized as they both are as nearly perfect as you can get."

      "content": "If you enjoy being touched and entertained by a movie, and yet you refuse to see this one because you \"don't like westerns\", then you are doing yourself the biggest disservice I can imagine. I GUARANTEE this film is not what you expect! I GUARANTEE you will be moved and affected by this powerful film. Hey, *I* have historically not enjoyed westerns, but this is quite possibly my all time favorite movie.I almost want to say this is not a \"western\" - just an superb realistic adventure which happens to take place in the \"west.\" It is an incredible story about real people living through a very true and difficult era of our country. (The late 1800's American West.)The characters are REAL and HUMAN, often flawed and heroic at once. There is not a single moment in the film that feels forced or overly dramatized. The characters never do anything against their nature for dramatic effect.\"Lonesome Dove\" is about people; about life; about love, faith, and perseverance in hard times. It succeeds in demonstrating these things through human drama, realistic adventure, and touching humor.Just read the rest of the reviews about Lonesome Dove!WATCH THIS MOVIE."

      "title": "The best....ever!",
      "content": "None of the viewer comments takes note of the book, on which the TV mini-series is based. When it first came out (it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction), the NY Times review said, \"..at 800 pages, it was far too short.\" I read it straight through. I couldn't put it down. The Tv film is absolutely faithful to the book. Robert Duvall, probably the greatest living film actor we have, recreated Gus MacRae as no one else could. When I was young, I spent five years cowboying off and on, working both ranches and feed lots, up the crescent of the high plains, from Deming, New Mexico up through Miles City, Montana. The book and the film capture the feel of working cowboy existence (which hasn't changed much over a hundred years) perfectly. Larry McMurtry grew up among cowboys and small ranchers. One of the viewers comments on the ease of racial relationships. From the Civil War on, probably a third of the cowboys were African Americans and Mexicans. It is a brilliant film, with brilliant acting, and a brilliant script."

Find out about Col. Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving - how they set up their cattle drives from Texas to Colorado and Wyoming and what happened to them (expecially Loving and Wilson's fight with some Comanches) and you can see that the beauty of Lonesome Dove is knowing that the story is not just fiction but has a basis in historical fact, this just adds to the quality of this series."
