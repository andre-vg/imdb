      "answer": "Yes, Hank and Dean are clones. It was revealed in the Season 2 premiere that the boys have died several times before and each time they do Dr. Venture just gets more out of his stash of clones. In a later episode Hank and Dean discover the lab filled with clones, but Dr. Venture is able to talk them out of thinking that they too are clones."
