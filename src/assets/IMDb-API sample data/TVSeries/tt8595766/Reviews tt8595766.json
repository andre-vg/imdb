Be it the doors of the house or be it the electric buttons, be it currency notes everthing they have taken care of. They have even taken care of the water bottle which was used by the kids in 90's.Direction and writing is just amazing. And the background music and songs they just get stuck in your mind, be it the title song or be it other songs. Just went back to my childhood with lots of nostalgic feelings. Keep making series like this TVF..!!!"

      "content": "I watched it after reading a tweet about it. Then when I was in the second episode a friend recommended it to me just the moment I was about to recommend the same to her. Just like telepathy. I knew this adorable story of a 12 year old Harshu and his family in The Summer of '98 was very special one. Being a 90's kid, I could relate to each and every detail here. The siblings' fights was so exactly similar down to the very argument on who had to bring the clothes from the terrace and fill up the bottles with water and put them in the fridge. I could relate to the fact that as kids we all think our parents are so not cool till that moment when we realize otherwise. Planning with friends, being the obedient one when parents fight, and sneaking around the kitchen to find something to eat- this web series took me back to my childhood and relive it all. It brought a smile to my face and that smile stayed there for the entire 35 minute long episode. Sometimes I cried overwhelmed by the immense nostalgic moments and endearing scenes. This 7 episode series has found a place in my heart. I would recommend it to everyone who have lived in the 90s. We live life in retrospect and nostalgia. This one offers lots of that. I sincerely hope that there is a Season 2 to this amazing series. Mona Singh as the mother was my ultimate favorite among the cast. Mostly because I could almost see my mother in her character- easily venting her frustration and anger, easily shouting at whoever is in the scene and then also easily breaking down when it all gets too much to handle. She was so adorable in the saree and that messy bun mothers have while making aloo tikkis and halwas. Love personified."

It also reminds me about how I felt when I left my family to pursue my highe education.

They have gotten all the bits which will make you take a trip down the memory lane. The feeling of nostalgia will take over and you will definitely cherish memories of the simpler times. The acting is terrific. The plot of each episode is well thought. The father-son, brother-brother, mother-daughter, brother-sister, mother-son moments make you think of your own childhood days. The crush, the bestfriend, the grumpy tuition teacher, all the parts are well played. In my opinion the show creators have just nailed the childhood of a 90s kid in this seven series episode."

      "title": "First time TVF gave high five to family show and it will pour so much emotions, entertainment and family drama that you will feel nostalgic in all 7 episodes.",
      "content": "Direction:TVF's the most lovable director Sameer Saxena gave great TV series e.g. Tripling and Permanent Roommates. His target audience was always Urban Youth. However this time he changed the track and go for family drama based on 90s. Execution was so touchy that you can feel the fragrance of 90s in these 7 episodes. If you are born in era of 80-90, you will definitely feel nostalgic after watch each and every episode.Performance:Every one is the performer in this TV series. Vishesh Bansal aka Harshu is the hero , villain and entertainer of this series. Now come to second most important character of this series. Undoubtedly Prasad Reddy aka Shanky stand on this position as his performance remind you pairing of Jai- Viru from Sholay (1975 hindi movie) or Kundan- Murari from Raanjhanaa (2013 movie). Shanky delivered dialogue as Preacher. Now come to Mona Singh (actor) the Ultimate Mummy for whole Gupta family. Akarsh Khurana has played super and cool dad. Ahan Nirban aka Dabbu has played his role according to nick name \"Dabbu\" , one ideal boy of family. Ruhi Khan aka Dhwani was cute and adorable. Revathi Pillai aka Vidhya can be crush of any 90s boy. Brij Bhushan Shukla showcase Sanskars in his acting.Script:Story-line of this show proved that Summer vacation is the festival of emotions, entertainment and family drama. Great research work to create the environment of 90s. It is really great inclusion of old things e.g. Comics, Cards, Milk shake with Rooh-Afza, Throwing milk into basin,Fashion TV and many other endless things which create connection with audience. All credit to goes to Saurabh Khanna for his writing skill.Dialogue:Any show or movie based on good writing and dialogue. Good thing about this TV series is that you will have witty dialogue which showcase witty writing.e.g. \"Papa 500 rupey jab de tab 100 rupey return kar dena. Papa 100 rupey vapas lege nahi aur Responsible behavior bhi show ho jayega\"Translate(\" Return 100 rs to father when he offer 500 rs to you. First thing father will not take back 100 rs and it will show your Responsible behavior\")Music:Title track was really impressive one and give boost to the TV series. Birthday song was cool one.Last words:After watching this season 1, you will ask me why i have given 4.75 stars, not 5 stars. My question to TVF why only 7 episodes? I need uninterrupted supply of this family show to my entire life."

Juhi parmar, rajesh kumar, hetal gada and co. Hv given earnest and sweet performances.The cinematography is very generic and is not very deserving of a decode. Its just decent. The music is good, but i noticed that the makers are using 'dhaaga' everywhere now. Make some more music please! Stop using it everywhere.The pop culture references of 90's is very good. Be it cable tv, caller id, shahrukh khan infatuation. The screenplay is engaging, but it moves from plotpoint to plotpoint. There is no extra room for us to know the characters. In the last episode, instead of saying that ritika should hv slapped dabloo, the show could have actually shown the family righteous and ritika would have slapped him in an ideal world. There are moments which will tug at your heartstrings.Its a sweet and good show. I rate it 8 out of 10."
