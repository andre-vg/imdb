      "answer": "Throughout the series, they are rich enough to afford a glamorous lifestyle. Gob once used the company's money to buy a boat.

After he went to jail, Lucille Bluth secretly ran the company and likely was able to keep the cash flowing. It has been a running gag in the series that the family are not really rich, and each member of the family embezzles money from Bluth businesses in their own creative way."

      "question": "When did George Michael and Maeby find out that they weren't blood relatives?",
      "answer": "In the first half of season one, George Michael learned that Maeby might have been made in a test tube and might not be Lindsay's biological daughter, and therefore might not really be his cousin. He decided to not share this information with Maeby until the second-to-the-last episode, \"Exit Strategy,\" which led to them going to second base. At the end of that episode, they saw the birth pictures which proved that Maeby was Lindsay's biological daughter. However, in the final episode, \"Development Arrested,\" it was revealed that Lindsay was adopted. At the end of Season 5, we learn that Lindsay is Lucille's half-sister, so George-Michael and Maeby are blood-related after all."
