      "question": "Why do they never use smart phones?",
      "answer": "While smart phones were a relatively new commodity when the show started, Kurt Sutter explains in the commentary, that by keeping them using simple flip phones, it helps keep the show from feeling dated. Also, because they're criminals, they use \"burner\" phones. Cheap, disposable phones that have a limited amount of talking minutes on them. Once the minutes are used up, you simply toss the phone away. These are popular amongst criminals because they are nearly impossible to tap or trace."

      "question": "Why do the associates of SoA need to keep buying guns all the time?",
      "answer": "Because once a gun is used, it would be discarded to avoid the user being caught with it. It's also possible the buyers re-sell the guns in their territories for a higher price."

      "question": "Is this show a modern retelling of Hamlet?",
      "answer": "Writer and creator Kurt Sutter has stated time and time again that the Pilot episode was partially structured after Hamlet. The reason being that it was easy to pitch to the network to give them a rough idea of what the plotline would be. However, Sutter has said the only real elements of Hamlet are that John Teller (the king) was murdered by his Vice President (Clay Morrow) and best friend (brother), and took the throne and the queen (Gemma) for himself, while becoming a father figure to Jax (the prince/Hamlet). Aside from those parallels, the show has little to no similarities to Hamlet. More recently, Sutter said \"The Hamlet archetypes will definitely influence the show, and I've talked about that quite a bit, but the show itself is not directly based on that narrative. But I think some of the archetypes are there, some of the relationships are there, and as the seasons progress you will see some parallels in terms of story and character arcs (as they) continue to play out. There is that awareness.\""

      "question": "Who is Sam Crow? What does SAMCRO stand for? Is there a difference between the two?",
      "answer": "SAMCRO is an acronym for Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Originals. Sam Crow is the personification of that acronym. It's how the club refers to themselves. Over time, the locals began calling them Sam Crow as well. In fact most of the members live in a part of Charming called \"Sam Crow's Corner\".Redwood Original refers to the Redwood Country, where they cruised the Northern California coast from Eureka to Big Sur -- Once they decided to settle in Charming CA, after Gemma became Pregnant with Jax, Charming was too cute for John Teller, so he named it the Redwood Originals instead."

      "question": "What exactly does the \"If you can't ride, you can't vote\" rule mean?",
      "answer": "As of season 5, it was finally revealed that if you're physically incapable of riding a motorcycle, you are forced to step down from any leadership position you might have and you will lose your privilege of voting in club business. Piney mentioned at one point that he rode his minimum simply to keep his voting privileges and he was shown to only be able to ride a three-wheeler yet was still allowed to vote."

    {
      "question": "What is RICO?",
      "answer": "In Series 4, the term RICO is often used when discussing the jeopardy in which the club is found.This refers to \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\" a US federal law that allows additional and often extensive penalties for crime perpetrated by \"criminal organization\". It was in part enacted to beat the Mafia. The RICO statute allows leaders of a criminal organization to be held accountable for crimes done by the organization over which they have authority or influence. It can also be used to limit convicted felons from participating in organizations such as those identified as potentially \"criminal\".Racketeering is using a group of people to run complex criminal activities, like gun-running, protection, etc."

      "question": "What's with the Homeless Woman?",
      "answer": "The Homeless Woman has appeared on Sons of Anarchy seven times. The first time is when Gemma approaches her and gives her some money during season 1. She appears again in the season 1 finale after Jax finds out that Tig and Clay were responsible for Donna's murder. Jax went on a bender and wound up falling asleep in the graveyard where his father is buried. When he wakes up, he gives the blanket he used back to the same homeless woman before going to Donna's funeral. In season 2, the homeless woman appears twice: once when Gemma was waiting for Unser outside of a church after Gemma had been raped. Gemma speaks to the homeless woman, asking if she knew her, to which the homeless woman replied, \"Everyone knows me,\" and before that when Gemma is waiting outside the shrink's office, where the homeless woman is already there, as if waiting to see the shrink herself. When the shrink comes out to the waiting room, she calls Gemma, not even acknowledging that the homeless woman is there. In season 3, the homeless woman appears when Jax is in Belfast following the husband and wife who had adopted Abel. While Jax is following them, the husband is seen giving some money to a homeless person who is asleep on the ground. If one looks closely, it's the homeless woman from Charming. In season 4, the homeless woman appears once again when Jax, Tara and the boys are on a picnic trip quite a distance from Charming. Jax sees her right before an attempt is made to kidnap Tara. The homeless woman appears again in the finale of Season 5. Jax sees her \"petting\" a dog doll in a garbage bin and continues on his way with a confused look.In the sixth season, the Sons encounter a teenage girl named Brooke Putner. She approaches the ice cream parlor which the Sons have relocated to after the destruction of their clubhouse prompts them to give up gunrunning and become a legitimate business, and she begins hitting Tig's bike with a wrench before throwing the wrench at the window. Jax tracks her down and discovers that she hates the MC because her mother Emily was killed in the infamous pileup which caused John Teller's death. Jax visits Brooke's father Gary and discovers that they have recently lost their house. Jax sees a photo of Gary and Emily on their wedding day, and comments that she looks familiar. Jax later meets with Elliot Oswald and asks him to help Gary and Brooke keep their house. Oswald agrees as he is running for mayor and may need favors. Brooke later comes to the shop and thanks Jax for helping them keep the house, apologizing for her earlier behaviour. Jax gives her a job so that she can pay off the damages. As Brooke walks home, she passes the homeless woman who is rooting through a dumpster. The homeless woman looks up and stares longingly at Brooke as she goes, implying that she is in fact her mother Emily.In the penultimate episode, Gemma sees the homeless woman at a truck stop hours before her own death. In the finale, Jax runs into her outside a courthouse where she is eating bread and drinking wine. He is happy to see her, but when he asks her who she is she simply replies \"It's time\" and gives him her blanket. Jax hides under the blanket on the steps of the courthouse and ambushes August Marks when he emerges, killing him in retaliation for Bobby's murder. At the end of the episode, Jax dies in a similar manner to his father, and the last shot shows a puddle of his blood flowing towards a piece of bread similar to the one the homeless woman was eating.It is worth noting that the truck driver Milo approaches Gemma when she sees the homeless woman at the truck stop, and that he also drives the truck that Jax collides with when he dies.Kurt Sutter has received a ridiculous amount of fan questions during his WTFSutter video blog regarding the homeless woman. The first few times he answered the questions he simply said, \"The homeless woman is who she is and represents what she represents.\" He further went on to say that he had no intention of explaining her for more than what the audience sees (so far at least) . He wants fans to make up their own interpretation of what she represents. Is she a guardian angel? Is she a ghost? Is she a mentally disturbed acquaintance of one of the characters? Is she just a homeless woman with a lot of frequent flier miles? To put it simply; the audience sees her for what she is. More recently Kurt Sutter has just started saying \"The Homeless Woman is Jesus Christ,\" though he seems to be saying this sarcastically, likely because he is getting sick of answering the question."

      "question": "Why did Jax cut his hair in season 4?",
      "answer": "An interview with Charlie Hunnam revealed that during his research he found that in certain prisons, long hair was frowned upon. So it may attract some unwanted hassle from guards and so on. Long hair is also a liability when fighting as it gives your opponent something to grab. Jax, at this point in his life is thinking about getting out of SAMCRO and starting a new life with his family. So in order to stay sort of under the radar and just do his time, Jax cut his hair to comply with any grooming standards a prison may have."

    {
      "question": "What does the \"Men Of Mayhem\" patch some of the members have on their cuts mean?",
      "answer": "It has never been said out loud on the show, but it's implied it means that a member has killed someone for the club. SAMCRO has voted on whether or not certain characters should \"Meet Mr. Mayhem\", the circumstances making that assumption likely. However, Tig, Chibs, Bobby and Happy have all been seen on screen killing people and the patch is absent from their cuts. Clay specifically gave Juice the \"men of mayhem\" patch for his cut (so called because it was historically a jacket with the sleeves \"cut off\") after Juice had helped the club ambush a group of Russians in a warehouse and then killed apparently in an attempt to catch a thief but in reality in self-defense to cover his own wrong doing, heavily suggesting that's how you earn the patch. Kurt Sutter has been quoted on twitter and other media saying that it means the member has done \"Something important\" for the club. But wouldn't be more specific. More recently, Kurt Sutter tweeted \"The 'Men of Mayhem' patch signifies that a member has shed blood.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "Why doesn't Sons Of Anarchy allow black people to join the club?",
      "answer": "This is revealed to be an \"unwritten by-law\" in the club. A rule that was instituted when the club was formed back in the 1960's. It's likely something the founding members agreed upon (or at least the majority, including Piney did). Keep in mind, during the 60's there was still a lot of prejudice and racial segregation that went on in the United States. In season 4 this subject is discussed between a few of the characters and it was basically stated that SoA as a whole is not a racist organization as they allow Jewish members, such as Bobby and Latino members among other ethnicities to join the club. While the modern day members have no issues with black people (Clay himself says \"We don't have any problem with colour...\") the club can't change the rule as it stands. Chibs (who is married to a black woman) reasons this by saying \"The rules have been around since day 1. It was a different time. I'm not saying I agree with them all. But if I start picking and choosing which ones to follow then the whole thing just falls apart.\". As stated above, it's an unwritten rule, so it's likely that only a few key members of the club would need to abolish the rule.In the final season, Jax pulls some strings and gets T.O. and possibly some other members of The Grimm Bastards (an all-black MC) patched into SAMCRO."

      "question": "What do the other patches that 1%ers wear signify?",
      "answer": "It's clear the show's researchers have explored MC lore and use it to give the show an authentic feel as there are additional patches that signal violence, aggression and similar \"antisocial\" behaviour, and all are present in the SoA show, both on SoA members and others.In \"Outlaw Motorcycle Gang\" (OMG) lore, a Man of Mayhem is one who undertakes acts of \"supreme violence\" on behalf of the club. It will say Man of Mayhem or sometimes MoM.These include a small diamond shaped \"1%\" patch, which refers back to a statement by the American Motorcycle Association that \"99% of motorcycle riders are law abiding citizens...\". the 1% statement says \"We're not one of those\". The same is true of a small patch saying MC, meaning Motorcycle Club- a statement that the organization is not about social groups, or common interests, it's about motorcycles. Law enforcement bike clubs will often wear a 99% patch to make a statement.Another common OMG patch is \"13\". Interpretations of the meaning differ, but the 13th letter of the alphabet is M, which can be said to stand for \"marijuana\" or \"methamphetamine\" and thus indicate the wearer has these for sale, or that the member has committed murder for the club (M for Murder) or can be commissioned to commit murder. Others say it's the number of people on the Jury plus a judge- and so only a club member can pass judgement on another club member (as they are Judge and Jury).An Ace of Spades patch (a black spade with an A in the middle) that in some Outlaw lore means having done a contract killing.Military insignia is common, especially since many clubs were formed by GI's returning from WW2 and then Vietnam. Clay wears paratrooper wings.Wings with different colours have meanings in some ways like the \"bandana code\" used by certain groups of people: these are often sexually related conquests and some say they exist only to provoke disgust at those who try to read the meanings of patches. For example, purple wings are often said to represent Necrophilia.Some very popular patches use skulls, the Grim Reaper and Nazi symbols, such as swastikas or SS death head. These are more likely to mean either white supremacy or rejection of social norms, or again just for shock value.The presentation and style of the major patches on the back of the cut can give a lot of information. The colours (what the large patches that identify the club are called) can have one, two or three patches and rockers. Rockers are the curved patches at the top and often the bottom of the back of the cut.One large patch with the insignia and name of the club is a \"one patch\" club, meaning it is most probably full of members coming from the 99% portion of motorcycle riders. Many of these will wear an \"AMA\" patch to show as members of the law-promoting American Motorcycle Association, they are absolutely not 1%-ers.Some clubs have a top rocker above the club insignia giving the name of the club. These are rarely outlaw bikers, but can be support groups.Outlaw clubs tend to have the insignia and top rocker (giving name) but also a bottom rocker giving territory. Real clubs become very possessive over territories, and larger, stronger clubs will not allow others to wear a rocker with \"their\" territory- a way of saying \"WE are the only club in this area....\". For example, in Texas, the one OMG is so strong, even law enforcement motorcycle clubs have had to drop the \"Texas\" rocker. Some 3-patch clubs will have a bottom rocker that say something else- occassionally it may say \"Provisional\" meaning the member is full but in their provisional membership period, or it may have the name of a country (if outside the US). Members of OMG who have earned the right to wear the top rocker and insignia are called \"patched\" or \"Full patched\" members, or \"patchholders\". Only patched members have a right to call themselves members of the club, and only patched members can get Tattoos of the club insignia- however the insignia, and this thus the cut, remains the property of the club and if the member ceases to be in the club, they must leave behind their cut (and if they leave in poor standing, they must remove or disfigure any insignia tattoos). This is referred to in SoA when someone who left the club had a tattoo burned off.EDIT: The Blue Knights (tm), neither in TEXAS nor anywhere else in the world have removed their lower rockers because some outlaw motorcycle gang told them to. That is simply false. Look up Texas Blue Knights and you see that they proudly and prominently wear the lower state rockers. The day that happens, Hell will have frozen over.Some riders/ members use a bottom rocker that says \"Nomad\" (as in SoA) meaning although members of the organization, they move around a lot or have no home address and so have no home chapter. In real life, this has been used to circumvent RICO prosecutions.There are other patches as well - For example, Some of the Mayans had a patch that said MFFM- that would mean Mayans Forever- Forever Mayans. A reminder that the Mayans come first to that person, before anything else.A Prospect would wear only a rocker that says \"Prospect\", as only a full member can wear colours.Other rockers, such as SAMCRO worn on the under arm area, are used to signify special charters or groups within the organization. Women are not allowed to wear the cut, or versions of the logo- although they may have a patch or shirt that says \"Property of.... \" the club. Women are often seen as property, and have no authority or voice especially over brothers, in genuine motorcycle clubs. Clay refers to this when in Series 4 he says to Gemma \"You're just an old lady- club business isn't your business\" and when Jax says of Gemma \"she's just the president's old lady\".That all clubs in that 1% use similar language and patches means they can communicate with each other about their ferociousness, their willingness to use violence and the general aggression of key members.This information about biker lore can be easily verified by checking any outlaw biker resource material."
