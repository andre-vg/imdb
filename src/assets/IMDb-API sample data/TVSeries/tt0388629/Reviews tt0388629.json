      "content": "Let me start by saying, I don't understand Japanese and I'm a huge fan of Naruto, Shippuuden and Bleach (of course, all original Japanese versions). One Piece was shown on Cartoon Network when I was 13/14 & I thought it was lame. Now, I see why it was lame, it was 4kids English version which was pretty horrible.Monkey. D. Luffy is the captain of a small group of pirates, famous as the Straw Hat Pirates. He recruits a small and diverse group of people who will be his nakama on the journey. He is more interested in food and nakamas than in gold & money as normal pirate would be. He is a comedian more than a captain, but he rises to the occasion when needed and he's a good role model. He wants to get to One Piece & become the King Of Pirates. He gets Roronoa Zoro on board first. He is a highly skilled swordsman & is known as the pirate hunter Zoro. He uses three katanas & its his ambition to become the best swordsman in the world. Then Nami comes aboard as the skilled navigator. Its her dream to draw the map of the whole world. After that, Usopp the storyteller (i.e he's a great liar) becomes their nakama.Next Sanji becomes their cook. His dream is to prove that All-Blue exists and he's an awesome kicker along with being a highly skilled cook. But, he loses it whenever he sees a beautiful lady. Then comes Chopper, a reindeer (you heard me right!). He becomes their doctor and he's very good at it. Then Nico Robin hops on aboard. Her dream is to find out about the ultimate Poneglyph, Rio Poneglyph. She has a power and a troubled past.This story is about taking the initiative to go for your dreams. Take the awesome adventures with Luffy and his nakama and you'll fall in love with them. There is comedy, spirit, love and an awe-inspiring factor in the anime. Even the animation which feels weird at first grows on you so much that you'll like this kind of animation more than the others.Now, I have just finished seeing the Sky Island episodes where Enel is fighting Luffy (200th episode). I have to say I am hooked to this show. This is definitely a show not for meant for kids. Even if you hate hearing the Japanese language, try seeing it for some episodes and you'll get hooked. I can't recommend this series enough. See it, believe it, enjoy it. This is my all time favourite anime, above Bleach & Naruto. This is miles above those anime. Anyone who has seen all three anime will agree with me!10/10"

      "content": "One Piece takes place in an alternate world where pirates rule the seas and anything can happen. Gold Roger was the Pirate King who had fame, fortune, and power. But when he was captured he was sentenced to be executed. On the day he was executed he revealed his One Piece treasure is hidden somewhere at The Grand Line.This made people set sail and try to hunt down the One Piece treasure. Many have failed and never found the location of it. But over the years it's drawn attention and formations on hundreds of Pirate groups who seek the title of Pirate King. The whole world has entered the Golden Era of Pirates.On one island lived a boy named Luffy, who is friends with a pirate named Captain Shanks. He looks up to Shanks as a hero. And would do anything to be part of his crew. But he was too young to become a pirate or part of any crew. One day Luffy encountered the Devil Fruit. He ate it and obtain the power the fruit hold. It gave him the ability to stretch with a body made of rubber. But once you eat the Devil's Fruit, you're cursed with the powers forever. And can never be able to swim again. After almost drowning in the water, his friend Shanks saved his life. As Shanks departs with his crew, he gave Luffy his prized straw hat. He told him to keep it with him, until they meet again. While Luffy was left feeling sad but honored at the same time.

Throughout the series, he'll find new lands, new allies, treasure, danger, and plenty of villains to face off. But with some faith and the powers of the Devil's Fruit. Luffy will sure to succeed his goal in becoming the Greatest Pirate that ever lived.Comic made back in the late 90s, and the anime series has been around since the earlier days of SpongeBob. I first heard of it when it came on the FoxBox back in late 2004. I wasn't entirely into many anime back then. And I never saw the English Dub of the series, as I found it to be an OK series. After reading on the internet that the dub is heavily edited and nothing like the original. I grew interest on how good it is. I read the first volume of the Manga series. And liked how the story was going.Wasn't until January 2007, when I finally start to check out the Anime. Only I viewed the episodes that are subtitled, uncut, and uncensored. And I grew to love it. The animation is very well done, it's funny, it's action packed, and it's dramatic sometimes. I don't even consider it a kid's cartoon, when it's more aimed to teenagers. But with an interesting cast of characters, and over a hundred secondary/miscellaneous characters. One Piece is indeed a great Anime next to Case Closed, Naurto, & other ongoing series.The reason why it's very underrated was because of 4Kids being the first company to distribute the anime. Which they edited and censored a lot. And many flaws in the dubbing. Such as voices that don't suit the characters' personalities. Too many pirate accents and catch-phrases that get old instantly. All the violence, blood, alchol, drugs, and nudity were altered and removed. All the weapons were altered to look harmless. 4Kids spent more time edditting than spending time on the scripts. Plus a lot of filler and small episodes were removed. And most of them were too important to take out in the series. The good thing is 4kids no longer owns rights to One Piece. I knew they would drop it, because they did a poor job in introducing the series to English speaking countries.With over 300 episodes, I can tell that One Piece is really big in Japan. I've seen all the current episodes. And can't get enough of it.So those who like their Anime uncut, should highly recommend seeing One Piece uncut by fan subs or Funimation's release on the series."

      "title": "This is what an anime fan should call home.",
      "content": "Looking at the IMDb reviews it seemed rather strange to me that most of them (the top ones at least) were quite outdated, written in 2005-2006 actually or the reviewers had not seen more than 50 or 100 episodes. Having said that please note that i have seen 610 episodes and 2 movies(strong world, film z) as of the day I'm writing this review. I hope my review will provide you with valuable insight to the series or even convince you to watch it. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible.It's been about a year since i started watching anime regularly and that is something I have yet to regret. I mostly enjoy short anime with less than 50 episodes that have good plot and well made characters, anime like cowboy bebop(my favorite), mushishi, ergo proxy, code geass etc. I knew about anime like OP, Naruto, Bleach even before I started watching anime but kept avoiding them even when I had seen about 50 (I must have seen over 100 now XD) other anime mainly because I thought to myself 'how can they be any good when they have that many episodes? Aren't they out of ideas yet?'. Well I might be right about Naruto and Bleach but when it comes to One Piece I couldn't be more wrong. One piece is so good, so enjoyable and it never ends which is something everyone who is watching it wants.Talk about long introduction huh? Anyways onto the actual review now. It will be divided into 4 sectors: story, characters, art and sound, enjoyment.STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward, a young boy Monkey D. Luffy (17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates. The series is divided into arcs, each featuring its very own story and setting, each island, each place the straw hat pirates (Luffy and his crew) visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances. And that's one of the best things of OP, you never get bored. You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it. Everything is interesting and everything is fun, Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers. That's something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly. Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series, especially Luffy, don't really care about their destination, hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all. All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things, get stronger, meet new people and face powerful foes. Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers (episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto, Bleach anyone?). Also the fillers are actually not that bad, sure they are not good but many of them are OK. And that's a huge plus for an anime series.CHARACTERS: This is where OP really shines. Each character is presented with great detail, they are all quite unique. Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are, why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams. Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other. We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other, they become something very close to a family. That's the kind of bonds they make. Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines. We see why they make the kind of choices they make. Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good. Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause, in their own justice and in their own dreams.ART AND SOUND: One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation. The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics. The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other (that's a huge plus in anime). The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors, I'm always talking about the original Japanese (don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters. The music, for me at least, is very catchy and actually really well made. However that depends on personal taste, if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it. Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime.OVERALL ENJOYMENT: One Piece is one of the most, if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find. It really excels in pretty much every field there is. It is the only anime series, or any series, I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me, have I seen a lot). I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure. If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not (oh you will want to continue). Trust me and you won't regret it, just like I did.And yep that's the end of it fellas. If you enjoyed my review and found it useful please upvote so others can see it.2021 update: I've been on the fence about deleting this since it's so poorly written, I was 17 at the time of writing and not a native speaker, and my opinion on one piece and anime in general has changed dramatically for the worse. But I figured I might as well leave it be since people seem to like it and it serves as a kind of snapshot of my 17 year old self whose input other hopeful 16 and 17 year adventurers out there might find helpful."

      "content": "(Review for both the anime and the manga, December 5, 2021, currently with 1034 chapters and 1001 episodes).Wealth, Fame, Power...Those were the words that started the greatest story of all time. Words that still hold massive amount of meaning in the story today. Words that will hold even more meaning when the story is ultimately brought to an end.We see how wealth, fame and power can impact the people of this world. That these things cannot bring happiness, and in many cases will just bring the complete opposite. Look at the Celestial Dragons. The most wealthy, powerful and quite famous individuals in the world. They view themselves as better than everyone else, that they can do whatever they want, even if it's incredibly inhumane. But in the eyes of the people that live beneath them, they are monsters. Monsters who are slaves to the wealth, fame and power they posses, and monsters who enslave. People who are not free, and take away freedom.Freedom.This is one of the core, if not the main element present throughout the entire series. Because, those three words ushered at the beginning of this story do not hold meaning in a persons life if that person is not free, and is willing to help others be free. They hold no power without freedom, because ultimately, the people like the Celestial Dragons, are not powerful people. They cannot sway the masses through the use of words and gain the trust of a random person on the street. They are feared. And does being feared make one powerful? Maybe. But people do not like to recognize it.The protagonist in this story, Monkey D. Luffy, wants to become the Pirate King, the freest man in the world. He wants to share that freedom, and is willing to with absolutely anyone. Even someone who may have attempted to kill him mere minutes ago. He is the pure embodiment of freedom, not giving a care in the world and just having fun.Another core element of the series is friendship. The crew of pirates you grow to love, are the best of friends. They will do whatever they need to do in order to keep each other safe, to keep the freedom they work so hard to gain. But challenge to take away that freedom, and you'll be sure you're not gonna get away easy.There is so much more I could say about One Piece. About the great characters, unmatched worldbuilding, and one of the greatest mysteries in any form of media ever. But that could go on forever. One Piece is not perfect, no story is. It has it's flaws. Sometimes humor doesn't land, maybe a fight scene isn't great, a character is just annoying, or even entire arcs that just drag and are sometime almost boring to sit through. But, there is just something special about One Piece that no series has ever been able to re-create, and I think will ever be able to create. It is truly something you should watch or read in your lifetime, and some of the values and beliefs can make you leave a better person. It did that for me. 10/10.Below are my ratings for each arc of the series below, if you are at all interested.Romance Dawn - 8/10 Orange Town - 6/10 Syrup Village - 6.5/10 Baratie - 8/10 Arlong Park - 9/10 Loguetown - 7/10 Reverse Mountain - 6/10 Whisky Peak - 7.5/10 Little Garden - 6.5/10 Drum Island - 8.5/10 Alabasta - 9/10 Jaya - 8/10 Skypeia - 7.5/10 Long Ring Long Land - 6/10 Water 7 - 9.5/10 Enies Lobby - 10/10 Post Enies Lobby - 8.5/10 Thriller Bark - 5.5/10 Sabaody Archipelago - 9/10 Amazon Lily - 6.5/10 Impel Down - 7.5/10 Marineford - 10/10 Post War - 7.5/10 Return to Sabaody - 7/10 Fish Man Island - 5/10 Punk Hazard - 6.5/10 Dressrosa - 8.5/10 Zou - 8.5/10 Whole Cake Island - 9/10 Levely - 7.5/10 Wano - 9.5/10 m."

      "content": "It is difficult to sum up the story of a series with hundreds of episodes, TV specials and movies, so I'd rather just try to tell you what it is about and why it is so incredibly good.The series starts off with a guy named Luffy whose ultimate goal it is to become the one and only \"King of all Pirates\" and to find the greatest treasure in the world. The first episodes introduce him and some characters and make a lovely start that is entertaining and makes one want more. On his way Luffy meets a lot of very interesting characters who become his crew members and friends - each of them with an intense and captivating background story. Every character in this series - be it friend or foe - is either adorable, tragic, despicable or interesting at the least... no boring characters anywhere. Later on in the series, important events and story twists are often visualized or supported by huge appearances in the fabulous and unreal environments that our crew travels. This is perfectly done and helps the already epic feel of the story. I have seen 150 episodes, four movies and two specials so far and there were moments that made me cry, laugh, think and re-watch some episodes (especially 85-90) at least 30 times. You might come to the false conclusion of having a kids show here due to the presentation, but that is definitely wrong. People sometimes say about a movie or series that it is \"not a life changer, but entertaining\". That is definitely not the case here! I know it sounds nerdy, but this series has broadened my horizon in many ways and I recommend anyone to take the admittedly long time to get into this epic adventure. The best way to do so will be to watch the fan-subs which are as close to the original as a non Japanese will get (explanations of puns and traditions). There are of course some filler episodes in a huge project like this which won't blow you away, but that is only natural with hundreds of episodes and helps developing the characters. This show is an easy 10/10"

Unlike any other long running series Anime and TV alike. If you let episode count to not watching it you are missing one hell of an adventure. Compare it to American TV shows where popularity and ratings defines the story a.k.a character assassination, rather than the author's original intent. You will find this much more appealing. P. S. I don't want to criticize American shows, infact I watch a lot of them. But hate it when the creators decide to make a character important just for the sake of it that makes me irritated."

This show's got great characters, a fun world and the action gets just enough punch to not be too boring or derivative of Toei's other Shonen-derived shows.This is an anime household name and anyone into Japanese animation should give this one a shot.

What is the Void Century and what happened during that time? Did Gol D Roger learn about it? I want the show to end to see the conclusion but I also don't want it to end at the same time. I hope no one in the crew dies later on, because Ace's death was sad, and he was just a side character, with little screen time and not even part of the crew. Even the Merry's death was sad and she's not even a living thing! I hope to see how this story progresses in the future!"

      "content": "I've followed this series for going on 15 years and it never fails to amaze me. From the characters to the world building, the details are everything here. Until almost 500 episodes in, I honestly forgot about the One Piece, because there is so much more going on. The emotional impact of each saga, and the naturally feel good vibe of this series can probably cure depression (I know it cured mine).At first glance, I like many others, skipped over this series because of the animation and overall goofiness that seemed to engulf it. I couldn't have made a bigger mistake. Don't be fooled, just like the real world, this world shows a coloful fun facade, but there is a much darker reality that lies underneath. The world is a very cruel and unfair place, but that can't deter you from achieving your dream and exploring all it has to offer.The main protagonist Monkey D. Luffy, embodies the human spirit as much as any character in fiction, and just like his rubber ability, he always bends but never breaks. His fiery passion and indomitable spirit to become \"King of the Pirates\" inspires those around him, and his fun loving, free spirited personality and compassion for his crew make him an excellent leader.The crew itself are full of different personalities and I almost guarantee that you'll relate to at least one of them. Each bringing their own strengths to the crew. As a fan of the original Dragon Ball, I loved the teamwork aspect and sadly, it's something that didn't carry over as well to DBZ, but was somewhat redeemed in Super. By which I mean, there was a point where Goku and Vegeta vastly surpassed everyone else. Whereas in One Piece, Luffy is the Goku of this series, but no one survives in this world alone and strength comes in all different forms, not just raw power. The strongest crew will find the One Piece, not the strongest person.Eiichiro Oda and his team have been producing chapter after chapter almost every week for over 22 years. The love and detail he puts into everything is noteworthy, and the anime should receive recognition for the voice acting and excellent score, despite how some people feel about the animation and pacing. It's still better than most.Whether you decide to read the manga, watch the anime or both, take your time and enjoy one of the greatest adventure series ever made."

Because there's no way an anime that is childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto.

What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. Luffy and the Strawhat Crews have their own unique characters that can be related to most of us in our daily life. The supporting characters and villains also have characteristics that will stuck in you mind for ages. I think that's why One Piece is the best. Most of us 'feel' for each of the characters in many ways...may it be in laughter, agony, suffering and so much more. Kudos to the One Piece's production team especially the amazing creator, Eiichiro Oda; for creating a world that is beyond ordinary but still can amuse ordinary people like me and you.A must see anime before you die..."

      "content": "On first glance, One Piece is not too different from other Anime series. It has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired.But in its core, One Piece is about something else: it's about nakama. Nakama, a Japanese term generally referring to comrades, receives a completely new feeling in One Piece. Stand by your nakama, believe in them no matter what happens, no matter what anyone does or says about them. Help them in any situation, even if it means putting your own life on the line. With you nakama, you can do anything. And it is this extreme sense of comradry that makes you fall in love with the characters and wish you could be a part of the strange little group.It also teaches how humans are allowed to have flaws; in fact, all people do: seemingly perfect Swordsman and first mate Roronoa Zoro has no sense of direction whatsoever and can easily get himself lost on any one way street, navigator Nami is absolutely crazy for money, cook Sanji loses his mind once he sees a lady.. and the list goes on and on. But despite these flaws, they continue fighting. For each other and with each other. If one crewmember can't do it, somebody else will be right there for support. If you're looking for a funny, action-filled series whose main characters easily grow to your heart and feel like family: go for One Piece. You will not regret it!"

I actually watched the first five episodes again in Japanese after seeing the English dub and it so much better. Apparently this show has been cut extensively to suit it for all ages witch does not do this show justice i think its quite friendly to children. Take my word for it watch one episode of One Piece on English. And then watch the Japanese version you will see the difference. This show is great and deserve so much more."

Also every episode in the series cannot be missed, since each episode has something to do with the storyline which make the show more and more addictive, unlike some other TV shows. There are even times where it can actually even make you care for the characters, which also make the show surprisingly moving.IMPORTANT: Beware of the English dub because it's been Americanised and politically-corrected to make it a kids show. It's been distributed by 4Kids. So in other words, ONLY watch the Japanese version otherwise the American version will turn you off."

      "title": "Tentative Review (Wano Country Arc)",
      "content": "I'm writing this possibly midway through the Wano Country Arc, the manga is still in Act 3 (of a potential? 5) and who knows how much is ~really~ left of One Piece. We could be looking at as few as 3 years or as many as 10. One thing is for certain, even though the ride isn't over, the ride so far has been absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best journeys fiction has ever offered. Eiichiro Oda is a literary genius.For being a manga and an anime that have taken no more than a few weeks breaks at a time, the quality to the quantity is beyond immaculate. From (basically) start to finish there has not been a dip in the quality of story-telling. One could say some of the best arcs took place earlier in the series, but that certainly doesn't discount just how fantastic some of the more recent arcs are. Even the (often contentious) Fishman Island Arc is leagues above some of the outstanding arcs of other popular manga/anime.Without diving too deep or giving too much away, one of the standalone factors that makes One Piece so beyond stellar is how impressively funny and brutally painful it can be, all within a couple pages or minutes. The fact that it is one of the funniest series in no way undermines the great depths of drama One Piece reaches. Are there funnier manga/anime? Are there sadder and more harrowing manga/anime? Yes and yes, but the fact that One Piece is such a master class in both comedy and drama only exacerbates just how freakishly human One Piece truly is. It captures beautifully the highs and lows of the human condition in such a way that seems impossible for a series with Devil Fruit abilities, haki, fishmen, sky people, giants, and singing skeletons.Beyond that, the thing that truly sets One Piece apart (and a term all too ubiquitous with the series) is its world building. The world of One Piece is MASSIVE, and that's not just describing the actual planet where the story takes place, but the lore, the characters, the relationships between characters so seemingly disparate the thread could only have been finessed by someone with a mind like Oda, a mind, mind you, that is no stranger to making obscure callbacks to details so minuscule hundred and hundreds of chapters ago that even the most devout fans can miss. One Piece is by and large one of the single most expansive fictional lores helmed by a single author (and illustrator!) For a little bit of context, the Lord of the Rings including The Hobbit is roughly 1,550 pages while One Piece is somewhere around 20,000 pages of illustration, and while a manga panel may not say exactly one thousand words, it's beyond commendable that one person could pen 20,000 pages of anything for one singular story. A singular story that encompasses so many characters, and insights, and backgrounds, and history, and minute details, that millions of people from virtually every country have come to see this tale and journey as something of a second world, a place they can escape to and join this magnificent captain and his ragtag crew as they journey to the end of the world.One Piece is truly something beyond magical, and when it eventually ends it will exist in the echelon of the greatest stories ever told. It could end right now and still make it into that category, but as any fan can tell you, the best is still yet to come. So, until then, this tentative review will have to do."

      "title": "Anime Of The Century... This Is Simply The Best!",
      "content": "The Anime \"One Piece\" takes place in a world where pirates rule the seas, Devil Fruits are scattered all over the world, and the most prized possession of Gol D. Roger is the target... One Piece!Gol D. Roger was the Pirate King who had fame, fortune, power, everything that anyone wanted to have... On the day of his execution, he revealed the location of his treasure, One Piece. He said that it is hidden somewhere in \"The Grand Line\".This made people set sail and try to obtain the treasure of treasures, One Piece. Sadly, many have failed and died trying to obtain it. But over the years, it has drawn attention to hundreds of Pirate groups who seek the title of Pirate King. The whole world has entered the Golden Era of Pirates. The Era where almost every pirate's dream is to become The Pirate King. They formed formidable crews to overcome those who are also seeking the treasure of treasures.This is where the story starts. The protagonist of the tale is a boy who had set his eyes on becoming the new Pirate King. The Boy's name is Monkey D. Luffy. He's the son of the most wanted man named Monkey D. Dragon and the grandson of Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp.Heads up, Portgas D. Ace is not Luffy's Brother. Ace is the son of the Pirate King and his real name was Gol D. Ace. He took his mom's surname Portgas, instead of Gol.On the island of East Blue, Luffy grew up in hoping to be a pirate someday. He befriends with a pirate named Captain Shanks. He looks up to Shanks as a hero and would do anything to be part of his crew. But he was too young at that time to become a part of the crew.One day Luffy accidentally ate the Devil's Fruit, Gomu Gomu (Rubber) that Shanks has at his possession. It gave Luffy the ability to become a human rubber. But once a person eats the Devil's Fruit, they'll be cursed with the powers forever and you'll lose the ability to move when they fall into the sea. Now Luffy is cursed to be a human rubber forever but vowed that even if he is cursed, he'd use this to his advantage to get the title of \"Pirate King\".As Shanks departs with his crew, he gave Luffy his most prized possession, his straw hat. He told him to keep it with him, until they meet again.A few years later, Luffy starts his quest to find some friends for his pirate crew. Throughout the series, he'll find new lands, new allies, treasures, dangers, and plenty of villains to face. On his journey to find new nakamas(friends), he met Roronoa Zoro the swordsman, Nami the navigator and thief, Usopp the Liar, Sanji the cook, Chopper the team's doctor, Franky the shipwright and Brook the musician.Their adventures can be unbelievably funny and other times, they're incredibly sad. There are only two animes that I cried on. This one and the other is Naruto. I can't hold my tears because this anime got into me.. Most of the background story of the characters are really really sad.This anime left me speechless the first time i saw it and it still leaves me speechless now.. And I still can't get enough of it. It even inspired me to create my own manga... The title is \"My Twelve Wings\" Hopefully, in the near future, it'll get published... hehe hopefully... I just started this morning but I already have an ending...Eiichiro Oda! You're my #1 favorite manga artist and thanks to you, the world of One Piece is made...Someday, I'll tell my future children and grandchildren the story of the almighty Monkey D. Luffy and his crew!I'll cherish this anime till the day I die"

      "content": "There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show. \"I don't like the art style,\" or \"I've seen the dub - NO THANKS.\" I'm guilty of both of these myself. But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece. For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is. If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh. They butchered it, there's really no other way to put it. They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series. FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go.As for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen. Much more \"cartoonish\" and maybe not what you'd expect from an anime. Despite that, you end up loving it. I wouldn't even say that you have to \"get used to it\" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way. It didn't even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before. Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have. Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at.Now that we've got those two points out of the way...One Piece is actually one of the best shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. The plot is pretty basic at first. Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure 'one piece' and become Pirate King, and he's looking for a crew to sail with him. You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them. They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities. They form one very quirky crew that's always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams. Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew. Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason. Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the series. No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses.The plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE. Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you'll ever watch. The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC. But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge. The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few. There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor.One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA.In a word, One Piece is perfect. And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say? It's been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end. It is, simply put, amazing."

Roger and the people become a pirate and search for The Great Treasure One Piece.Then Shanks met with Luffy and Luffy decides to be a Pirate King. Shanks save Luffy's life and lost his arm and I heard from Oda (The Creator of One Piece) Shanks losing his arm but his strength is never changed. Shanks give Luffy the Straw Hat.

The Straw Hats going to the Grand Line.ArabastaReverse Mountain We see Laboon and the Gold Roger's crew doctor.Whisky Peak Zoro's fights were very good.

Usopp loves and admire the giant people so much. The fights scenes are very good.Drum Island We saw the Tony Tony Chopper the Doctor of the Straw Hats Pirates. As I remember we see Ace in this arc. Chopper joins the crew.Arabasta It's a masterpiece arc. I love all the fights especially Zoro's fight. I love Crocodile so much. He is a great villain and we see the one of the greatest character in One Piece. Bon Clay we love you so much. The Crew gets new bounties. Lastly Nico Robin joins the crew.Sky IslandJaya They try find a way for go to Sky Island and Luffy one shots Bellamy. That was a great scene.Skypiea They fight against God Enel. He has my favorite devil fruit. The Thunder is so powerful and perfect but Luffy win against him because he is rubber. Most of the people say it was a boring arc but I don't think that way it's really good.Water 7Long Ring Long Land It's boring arc. My least favorite but it has some good fight scenes especially Zoro and Sanji.Water 7 We see Franky and learn strange things about Robin. We see The Great CP-9 and they take Robin. We learn sad things about Merry and Usopp leave the crew.Enies Lobby This arc. Just Masterpiece. It was perfect the fight scenes, the story line, the characters. They take Robin back and run away from Enies Lobby. If Merry wasn't there they all dead right now. Merry saved them. But end of the arc we are saying goodbye to our friend Merry.Post-Enies Lobby The crew had new bounties. We saw Garp, Aokiji, Helmeppo and Coby. They had a new ship name Thousand Sunny Thriller Bark Brook comes to crew. Zoro got his new sword. The Fight scenes are perfect and we see legendary scenes. ''Nothing Happened''Summit WarSabaody Archipelago This arc is so good to. We saw the Worst Generation. We saw Rayleigh, Kizaru (My favorite Admiral) and we see the most satisfying thing in One Piece. Luffy's punch but end of the arc the crew split up the different islands.Amazon Lilly We saw Hancock and Luffy's amazing King Haki's. Luffy learn something bad about Ace and he want to go Impel Down because of it.Impel Down We saw Bon Clay, Mr. 3, Buggy, Jinbei, Crocodile, Ivankov. This arc was so good. Luffy want to take back Ace but he can't do it.Marineford I don't know what I am going to say about this arc. It's the best arc for now. War is amazing. All of the characters are perfect. The Luffy's Haki is perfect. Just perfect but Ace died in the Great War. That's one of the saddest moments in One Piece.Post-War We saw Luffy's back-story and we see Sabo's dying. Shanks and Marco pay their last respects to Ace and Whitebeard. All of the crew starts 2 year training.Fish-Man IslandReturn to Sabaody Crew gets together in Sabaody Island. They changed. We see The Fake Straw Hats. I hate them so much.Fish-Man Island Again most of the people don't like this arc but I really love that arc. All of the fights and storyline is very good but maybe one thing is bad. The Villains. I don't like them. It could be better.DressrosaPunk Hazard It's really good. We saw Smoker, Trafalgar D. Water Law. The Fights are amazing. Especially Law. Luffy's new techniques are really good. The animation is perfect. I really love that anime.Dressrosa This arc just perfect. Luffy's Gear 4, Zoro vs Pica, Usopp Observation Haki, The Story Line, Bartalomeo, and Fujitora. Fujitora is a great guy. I loved him. The back stories are perfect. We learn that Sabo is alive and he is got Ace devil fruit. Just perfect. End of the arc The Straw Hat Grand Fleet is formed and the crew got new bounties.Four EmperorsZou Zou arc is good. We learned something bad about Sanji and Luffy decided to take him back so he is going the Whole Cake Island but some of the crew go to Wano.Whole Cake Island This arc is perfect. I can't handle it anymore. There is too much awesomeness. The Fights, Sanji's back-story, Luffy's fate in Sanji, Katakuri vs Luffy. That's a perfect arc. Most importantly The MVP of this arc is Brook. He did so much important thing in this arc. End of the arc Luffy and Sanji got new bounties and Luffy become The Fifth Emperor.Levely We saw a lot of important thing in this arc. Imu Sama, The Big Straw Hat and something happened to Sabo but we don't know it right now and we learn that The Warlord System is removed.Wano Country Wano. A masterpiece. The animation is perfect. The fights, Oden back-story, The reunion The Straw Hats, Wano's beauty, All of it perfect. This arc is my second favorite arc. It's still ongoing but the end of it I'm sure that is is going to be a number one.That's it. If you're not watching One Piece, you're missing a lot. It's a Masterpiece. Don't scared the numbers of episodes. You will not regret and most of the people say it will be better after 300th episode or 400th episode but they wrong it is perfect from the start. You must watch it right now.Thanks for reading."

Luffy is easily the best Main Protagonist of the Big Three in my mind and is the perfect balance of comedy and seriousness in battle. The absolutely fantastic characters of One Piece are really what makes the story, and there at least one or two that you'll take an instant liking too."

      "content": "Shonen manga is a really biased genre. Not only for people who only see manga as \"japanese cartoons\", but for people who only like Naruto or hate all shonen too. One Piece, however, is so original and deep that any art critic could look at it as a romance book rather than plain entertainment. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year old boy who consumed a mysterious fruit which made his body have rubber properties and his dream of finding a legendary treasure called One Piece, thus becoming the Pirate King. My description sounds dull, because it is really hard to explain even one percent of the complexity of this show. It is about dreams, about promises, about the value of life and about so many things that every new arc becomes a new life experience. Of course, the quantity of episodes may scare people, but after some few arcs, it makes the viewer feel every single message transmitted through the story. The storyline is really surprising, and every new episode can change what you thought to be certain. The details are not spared by the author, and are commonly used in further episodes. This attention to small things make the story progress in a beautiful and quick way. The character roster is rife with complex personalities/back stories, and it is really hard not to love them (with the exception of Donquixote Doflamingo). If you want some good story to laugh and have fun, you may like it. If you want adventures, art and romance, you will love it."

      "content": "Incredible stories that keep you hooked on the storyline of the entire anime. Once you stop it's hard to stop watching as the episodes are normally quite action packed and interesting as the come across various foes and allies. There are filler episodes that give you a break from the intensity of main fights against bosses/evil organisations. It also manages to subtly teach the viewer morals and life lessons that one should live by. Honestly is a life saver and would recommend for everyone regardless of their age or preferences for entertainment as it caters for everything. It is goofy and funny and well as really awesome and entertaining. It is a must watch!"
