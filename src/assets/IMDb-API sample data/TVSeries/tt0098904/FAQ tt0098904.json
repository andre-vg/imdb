      "question": "Is it true that there is a Superman reference in every episode?",
      "answer": "No. Some viewers have thought that this is so because in many episodes there is a Superman magnet on Jerry's refrigerator and/or a Superman figurine on his bookshelf. However, the first Superman reference was in \"The Stock Tip,\" the fifth episode of Season 1; the magnet did not appear until the episode \"The Shoes\" in Season 4 and the figurine did not appear until later, so most episodes from the first 3.5 years of the show have no Superman references at all."

      "question": "Who are the characters based on?",
      "answer": "Jerry is based on himself. George is based on co-creator Larry David. Kramer is based on Larry David's old neighbor, Kenny Kramer. It was rumored that Elaine is based on comedian Carol Liefer, who wrote for the series and who Jerry Seinfeld dated. However, this was denied. According to Jerry Seinfeld's biography, Elaine was based in part on Susan McNabb, who was dating Seinfeld when the character was created, as well as Monica Yates, who Larry David once dated. Some of the peripheral characters also have real-life counterparts. Jackie Chiles is based on famed attorney Johnnie Cochran; the Soup Nazi was based on the real-life owner of a soup kitchen in New York; J. Peterman and George Steinbrenner are caricatures of their real-life counterparts."

    {
      "question": "How did the characters meet?",
      "answer": "Jerry and George met in high school and became best friends. Jerry and Elaine began dating in 1986, shortly after Jerry moved into his apartment and after Elaine moved to New York. It is unclear how they met. Jerry and Kramer met after Jerry moved into his apartment across the hall from Kramer. It is suggested that Jerry's off-handed remark that \"what's mine is yours\" provoked Kramer's subsequent mooching."

      "question": "Who is David Berkovitz/Son of Sam that Newman keep referring to?",
      "answer": "David Berkowitz aka 'Son of Sam' was an infamous serial killer/arsonist who terrorized New York in the late 1970s. He was also a postal worker and Newman claims to have known him and even that they double dated together. He also claims to have taken over his route and inherited his mailbag (which Kramer uses as collateral for his gambling debts) but he is probably lying as Berkowitz was never actually employed as a letter carrier. George also refers to him in 'The Junk Mail'."

      "question": "What is a Good Samaritan Law? (The Finale)",
      "answer": "In the four observe a robbery and do nothing. They are arrested for violating a Good Samaritan Law.Good Samaritan Laws are often confused with a duty to rescue. In the U.S., there is generally no duty to rescue. Good Samaritan Laws refer, instead, to \"protecting from blame those who choose to aid others who are injured or ill. They are intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury.\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_lawhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_rescueThe gang is arrested in Massachusetts - see Massachusetts exception in Duty to Rescue link. This law creates a duty to report, but not a duty to aid. Chapter 268, section 40 provides \"Whoever knows that another person is a victim of aggravated rape, murder, manslaughter or armed robbery and is at the scene of said crime shall, to the extent that said person can do so without danger or peril to himself or others, report said crime to an appropriate law enforcement official as soon as reasonably practicable.\" \"These laws are also referred to as Good Samaritan laws, despite their difference from laws of the same name that protect individuals that try to help another person. These laws are rarely applied, and are generally ignored by citizens and lawmakers.\" --Wikipedia.Larry David said, on the Season 9 DVD featurette \"The Last Lap,\" that the germ of the idea for the Finale came from a law he heard about in France. Clearly, the philosophical and legal concepts of a duty to rescue someone to whom you have no special relationship vary around the world. This is a very interesting area of philosophy and law; however, the Finale does not portray an accurate representation of U.S. law, in particular because a police officer was on the scene the entire time.
