      "title": "So much better than the American version",
      "content": "If you like the American version, it is heavily based on this one. However, the acting if far superior in the Swedish-Danish version, in fact I think it is one of the best cast series I have seen. If you can deal with the subtitles this is so much better. As you watch the show characters are introduced that seem to have little to do with the plot, but in a few episodes they become important. This is good in that you start to wonder what this character's involvement as the plot progresses. There is a grittiness to drama that is missing from US shows, with the characters being not such overly made-up dolls. It is interesting to see how the scenery differs from what once is accustomed to in the US.The third season was the most fantastic. Sofia Helin really showed what she is capable of as an actress as her character is put into extremely uncomfortable situations, and I Thure Lindhardt was also phenomenal with is character was having to deal with the loss of his family 6 years before and is having problems accepting the loss. The two interact so well."

      "title": "A great new detective duo",
      "content": "This Danish/Swedish co-production starts in dramatic style when a body is found in the middle of the Øresund Bridge; half in Denmark, half in Sweden. Swedish officer Saga Norén claims the case should be dealt with by the Malmo police as the head is in Sweden and she recognises the victim as a local councillor. Martin Rohde, the Danish officer sent to the scene doesn't object and it looks as if that will be that until it is realised they are dealing with two half-bodies; the top is the Swedish politician but the bottom half belonged to a Danish prostitute who had been killed a year before! Clearly the killer had been planning this for a long time. It soon becomes apparent that the killer has no intention of stopping at two deaths; he has a series of events planned and each event is intended to highlight some perceived injustices in the two countries.Saga and Martin are two very different characters; she is totally by the book, very direct but not at all empathetic... it is never explicitly stated but it seems likely she has Asperger syndrome; Martin meanwhile is far more relaxed about breaking the rules, he is also feeling rather sensitive in the early episodes though as he has just had a vasectomy! For a series with some fairly brutal crimes there are a surprising number of laughs; mostly because of Saga's behaviour. That might sound as they you are laughing at a disability but that wouldn't be the case; she may behave differently but her total lack of subtlety doesn't hold her back even if it does get her some funny looks; Sofia Helin is brilliant in the role, making her character one of my favourite TV detectives. While a more conventional character Martin, played by Kim Bodnia, is still entertaining to watch and makes the perfect foil to Saga. It isn't just a two person show though; the killer broadcasts his message by contacting a newspaper reporter and an early suspect is a Swedish social worker whose sister nearly becomes a victim of the killer. The mystery might be a little cliché... serial killers usually are... but the execution makes this series a joy to watch; there are plenty of twists and turns before we finally learn who the killer. Once we learn the killer's identity things do get a little melodramatic but that was okay as the conclusion was both exciting and shocking.I would certainly recommend this to fans of detective fiction; particularly if you've been enjoying the various continental imports aired on BBC4... even if you are put off by the idea of watching something in another language give it a go... after a few minutes one barely notices that one is reading the subtitles."

In certain aspects it surpassed The Killing (Forbrydelsen) and is overall on par with Sherlock.For some reason all Scandinavian crime dramas and thrillers are bleak and grimy. This is in contract to one of the best living standards in the world and supposed happiness it should bring.There have been complaints about Sofia Helin's performance. She plays a person that is obviously afflicted with a syndrome or a condition. In that sense, she offers a finest performance, not a lesson in \"wooden acting\" as it had been implied. In an interview she stated how her inspiration has been a goat, on a level that she follows her instincts.Kim Bodnia is great and the rest of the crew is above average. Overall, this is a great show."

      "title": "Wow, keep em coming from northern Europe!",
      "content": "Note please that this a review of the original Swedish version, with subtitles, not the remake. I apologize in advance for preferring originals -- the original, in Japanese, of the Ring, for example, was a much better horror film, but did I admit lack the luminescence of Naomi Watts. And the original of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, one of the best vampire movies ever -- with an odd POV no one has come close to matching -- was set in the snowbelt of Europe, and no remake in Mexico is going to come close. Apologies aside, this show hit the trifecta of miniseries. 1. First, astonishing story. A body found on the boundary line of two countries, bisected right down the middle, so two cops from 2 different countries who arguably don't even like each other (initially) have to work together. 2. Relationships. I confess by the final instalment I was less interested in catching the bad guy than in the ongoing relationship between the aforesaid two cops. 3. Acting. It is stellar throughout with no weak performances, but the most astonishing thing in the production is Sofia Helin. First, she is pleasing to the eye, and the camera knows this, so 100s of closeups. No objection from this viewer. Second, she has to \"sell\" a role which sees her as a top-tier female detective in a man's world who clearly has either Aspergers or some form of autism, and yet is constantly trying to do the right thing. I don't want to spoil it for you -- which I guess is why they call em spoilers -- but look at the scene where she has to explain to her new, non-domestic, \"partner cop\" why, when the teenage son of said cop asked if he could stay overnight at her place ... she agreed! Well, the acting, the reaction shots, the whole tone just screams potential for taking these characters and basing a whole NA show on them. (OK, call that a prediction, lets see what happens on this side of the ocean)"

      "title": "Great stuff",
      "content": "The Scandi-dramas keep on coming on BBC4. This one is a corker. It's right up there with 'The Killing' - and that's saying a lot. OK, the story is not really credible, but it's a thriller, and that's what thrillers tend to be like. It fulfils the main criterion of a thriller: it's thrilling - and it kept me glued to the screen throughout (the subtitles actually help you to focus).The best thing about the serial is the characterisation and acting. Saga! What a character. What an original. How brilliantly played! As time went on she became more and more fascinating, and in the last two episodes... I can't explain without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it yet. Let me just say that it becomes very moving.What about her partner, Martin? At first he seems to be a jovial teddy bear of a family man, but he is gradually revealed as a much more complex person. The interplay between him and Saga is perfect.There are other good characters, too. The son, August, is excellently portrayed, and really comes up with the goods at the crucial time.Admittedly, there are weak points, such as two slightly pointless sub-plots/red herrings, and a killer whose doings are not terribly believable and whose role is not very convincingly acted. Some events are skated over and mysteriously ignored once they have happened. One suspect in particular is questioned in the most perfunctory way, to allow neatly for more mayhem.All that aside, it's fantastic. If you get the chance to see it, don't miss it."

Both the story and characters are believable and not overacted, like the many, many Hollywood variants.Also a very important aspect is the overall story line. Too many police/detective shows have a 1 or 2 case per episode methodology and hardly a background story. That gets old fast. Bron/Broen does this well: one (big) case (so far) with many other related things happening for following episodes.Have seen only 2.5 episodes so far, but had to mention this. Excellent!"

      "title": "Absolutely brilliant: one of the best crime drama series you'll ever see",
      "content": "A dead body is found in the middle of the Oresund Bridge, the bridge connecting Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden. Due to the location the Copenhagen and Malmo police need to collaborate to find the murderer. This brings together Saga Noren and Martin Rohde and the two could not be more dissimilar.Fantastic crime drama series. Incredibly clever and complex plots that keep you guessing to the last moment. Heaps of twists but not for twists' sakes: it all makes sense and ensures you can never take anything for granted. No spoon-feeding of information: you need to be thinking all the time and working things out for yourself - just like crime dramas, and dramas in general, should be.The sink-or-swim nature of the information goes so far as to introduce sub-plots and characters which for many episodes seem to have nothing to do with the main plot. They just seem like a light distraction, a way to rest your brain after concentrating on the case. However, these always have a major bearing on the case - the writers are just setting up the backstory for when the sub-plots flow into the main plot. Very clever and engaging in the way it's done, plus another way for the writers to give you a headache as you wonder what how these characters or sub-plots fit into the story.Its not all about solving the crimes though. There's a great deal of human and relationship drama . Saga Noren's character is quite weird - overly rational, socially maladjusted, very cerebral and calculating, very direct - while Martin Rohde is much more diplomatic, feelings-driven and impulsive. The chalk-and-cheese nature of the pair makes for some wonderful interplay between them. It also leads to many laugh-out-loud moments: some of Noren's utterances are incredibly funny as are the way the two play off each other.The only slight blip in the series came in Season 3 when a major character was replaced. Initially the series didn't feel the same as the relationship dynamic changed. However, in the long run it works out fine and leads to some incredibly emotional scenes and sub-plots towards the end of Season 4.Superb."

I've seen the first 9 episodes and was amazed by the exciting storyline, the twists and Kim Bodnias acting. Sofia Helins performance isn't top notch but the character is so amusing and hilarious so you cant do nothing but love her. as long as you don't have to meet her in real life. =)Those of you out there who just watched one episode and thought \"this is crap. Cant stand watching this piece of *beeep*. Let's watch Wrestling instead\" just don't know what you missed.

I have to say she makes the show for me, alright she is blonde, beautiful and Swedish, but her performance is exceptional and you can't help but love her character. Saga works very well with Martin in trying to solve the crimes and the satellite characters and stories work equally as well. I also have to mention the direction, camera work and general production of this series as it is as good as anything I have seen. I shall be very sad when it finishes."

There were a lot of similarities so i could eventually guess what would happen in episode 9 and 10, but it didn't ruin the experience at all.Acting was great, i loved the characters that Sara Helin and Kim Bodnia are playing, and the complicated story of finding out who the serial killer is and what the motivation is really plays out well.

The story is intriguing from the start: a corpse is found on the bridge between Denmark and Sweden, carefully positioned so that each half is in a different country. The story that evolves from there is satisfactorily complex, without getting silly, and full of suspense. There are a lot of interesting characters in the series, but the stars are the two investigators. Saga Noren, who clearly has a fairly serious Asperger syndrome, mixes an infuriating lack of understanding of people's feelings with an endearing innocence and admirable honesty. Martin Rohde, a more traditional investigator, is a man that often doesn't really think about the consequences of his actions,and is willing to break rules. The relationship between these two provides a lot of interest and plenty of really entertaining moments. Everything is greatabout this series - the story, the ending, the characters, the music,the photography (the night shots of the bridge and the city that are interspersed during the series are mesmerising).

I was not sure how good this would be without Martin, but by episode 2, you are not even thinking about Martin. They introduce a new partner/s for her whom have their own unique story and problems. You are not sure what is going on with them for at least a few episodes, which I liked very much. It ends up working well on many levels. Saga's story goes deeper and is heartbreaking, as we learn more about her. Characters from her life come in and cause her troubles and it is hard to watch yet gives us more insight into her and why she is like she is. The actress who plays her can convey so much with her face and body, the way she shows us her distress as the personal tension starts to ramp up made me want to cry for her. I have to say this show has kept me on the edge of my seat and I have not been sure what is up or who did what most of the time, nor what was going to happen. This show is so well written and unique. I appreciate the uniqueness of it on all levels. There are many plot threads going on at once and they all work. Also I love how they manage to constantly work that bridge into the story visually. It is beautiful and meaningful in the context of the story. It does not feel disjointed but tightly woven and interesting. The finale was excellent and surprising. The acting is so good by the two leads, they are sure to win some awards.I love this genre but after so many decades of watching cop mysteries, there is not much left you cannot guess or figure out these days. This series manages to rise above that.I am sure they will do a season 4. The Bridge/Bron/Broen is wonderful and well made. It deserves to be winning awards in their country and where ever they can. Watch it.2018 Update- The final season, which was season 4 was excellent. The show is true to each character and ended realistically. Very very good."

It is a tremendously well-written series with superb multi-layered and multi-faceted plots and sub-plots, meticulously assembled with extreme care, polished with beautiful filmography, sceneries and shots. It is my opinion that the Scandinavian writers and producers of such series are one of the best in the world, if not the best. Their major forte is the care and thought that they put in the script and storylines, with awesome attention to details, deep calculation of events, all without any destroying rush. Their work is truly awesome and a masterful creation.With that being said, and being specific to this series and to its acting this time, IMO, Sofia Helin (Saga Noren) steals the show on all levels, notwithstanding the series wonderful cast and acting, first and foremost, Kim Bodnia, the captains and the professional, bright and very likable medical examiner with his serene personality, attitude and calm behavior in all circumstances. Kudos also to the SWAT teams on both sides with their realistic gears, professionalism and performances, especially the more shiny Swedish Force.Returning to Sofia Helin (Saga), her stellar performance is so amazing that she deserves tons of praise and recognition, making words come short of describing the truly difficult and brilliant job that she did in portraying and bringing such a character to life. I loved with awe her focused, robot-like, knowledgeable, unforgiving and brutally honest character. She wouldn't ever give up, was hard working as hell, stubborn and stone direct. It was a peak pleasure to follow up her greatest play and I, actually learned quite a lot from her. Syndrome or no syndrome, her acting and character personality were unique to her in the most positive and award-winning ways.Many may not like and even despise her personality, facial expressions and behavioral portrayal in the show, but to me she was like a very bright and blinding light in the dark tunnel confines of the series. She will be unmatched for a very long time.Bron Broen was a unique joyful experience to watch and finish its four seasons. I won't differentiate between them. All were tremendously good and well-made with the masterful heading of Saga Noren, the lead female investigator.To all those who watched it already and to curious viewers who might want to give it a try, this gem comes highly praised and recommended, setting the Standard bar higher and an unforgettable experience well worth the time spent on it.Watch it to believe it!Sofia, you redefined your role on a whole new level. You have all my heartfelt esteem and undying respect."

I have seen other Scandinavian series and this one is up there on the list, different than Wallander for example, but quirky aspects that draw you in. The characters in shows from this region have flaws and character aspects that make you think. For US made shows, the lead police are shown at their strongest with some defining characteristic that makes them and their team the best. I think the humanity shown in the Bridge draws me in more. Also, from a US perspective, the morality and rules of conduct interest me for this show."

And they unfortunately confuse it with bad acting in their reviews. Well, well...To me that mistake never became a problem. Then again, I am myself a person with a Autistic spectrum of High-functioning type (HFA). A \"near cousin\" to Asperger. And I was simply stunned. Sofia Helins interpretation of a police-officer with Autistic spectrum of Asperger type was just excellent. Maybe not perfect, but excellent. And it is without a doubt one of the best performances I've ever seen, made by an non-autistic actress/actor. (Watch out, Dustin Hoffman *wink*)The chemistry between the actress/actor Sofia Helin and Kim Bodnia are excellent as well. I'm actually not going to say anything about the plot itself. It would be wasteful. Just be aware that the female police-officer in the series actually is a person with Autistic spectrum of Asperger type (for less confusion), see the show, and be amazed. I was.Me, I'm now impatiently waiting for \"Bron/Broen 2\", which is planned to be aired 2013."

She is great. And, despite what another reviewer has said, she is hot. Irrelevant, but fact."

      "title": "Whoa! What an excellent criminal series!",
      "content": "A little background: I'm from U.S. and a few years ago, some friends had recommended I watch 'The Pusher' 3 part series, and that was so realistic, so entertaining, that I started following the main actors, see what other films they had done. And recently I'd done a search, and found Kim Bodnia was in this series, so that was main reason for watching it, plus, like many, I'd seen the U.S. version of The Killing and was curious again about Scandanavian movies.So I read the reviews on here, and obtained and began to watch this series. I immediately liked the police officer played by Sofia Helin, and I presumed she had some sort of autism, tho I don't know enough about it to be sure, and figured maybe it was more an antisocial thing, but after a few episodes it became really appealing, and I've always liked Bodnia's gritty acting and he seemed a good counterpoint to Helin.It didn't take but one episode to get me caught up in the crime drama, either. It was complex, and I had to go back a few times, and I could see the subtitles were lame at times, but still, when there are subtitles I just depend more on the acting, and it was great. The violence was there, but not like US movies where it is overdone and become boring and cartoon like, here it was sparse and credible. I found myself truly frightened for the victims, and worried to the last episode over the fate of certain people.Don't miss this one: I couldn't leave the screen it was so good. And I think myself that some of the role comprised in the US version of The Killing comes from this series, not from the original in Sweden, but the lack of emotion and inability to empathize that the police lady had in this series: well I think that was what the US actress was *trying* to achieve in her role. Watch this series, and then think of the US actress who played the police detective in The Killing.Great series though,and one of the best crime stories I've seen"

      "title": "Brilliant portrait of the asperger cop",
      "content": "The series starts with a dead woman found on the Öresunds-bridge between Denmark and Sweden. As the body is place exactly on the border between the countries the investigation is shared by the Danish and Swedish police. The interaction between Sara Helin (playing Saga Norén, Swedish police) and Kim Bodnia (playing Martin Rohde, Danish police) raises this series above the average serial killing series. It's interesting to see their relationship develop on screen through plot twists and dead-ends. Especially Sara Helin as Saga is brilliant as an asperger affected Swedish police officer.I fully understand how some reviewers can mistake the acting as horribly bad - but given the background of the character it is simply very good. Sagas inability to relate to human interaction constantly leads to a comedy of unintended errors but it never over-shadows the actual plot.The plot itself moves forward with a decent pace (for a European/Scandinavian series; think \"The Killing\") but it has some sub-plots that seems slightly unrelated to the main story. Nevertheless it is well worth viewing for the brilliant main characters."

The new episodes just started in the Nordic countries, so I will not spoil the fun, it's a must watch. The leading role ( brilliantly played by Sofia Helins) is better than ever. If any actress deserves an Oscar or Emmy it should be Sofia."

The acting is brilliant especially from Sofia Helin and I was always invested on what was happening. The mysteries were a bit unrealistic at times but I only noticed that when ir eally started thinking about them, and they still remained interesting. The solving of these cases always surprised me and never felt underhwhelming. At times the show got pretty intense but it's more of a personal thing if you get scared by these types of shows. Overall I would give this a 12/10 if I could, this is what is called a masterpiece."

      "title": "A well-made series",
      "content": "This series is about the co-operation between a danish and a Swedish cop in solving a string of murders in the Copenhagen/Malmo area. I would advice readers not to listen to people who didn't even bother watching at least half the series before writing a review. Truth is, the show is a bit of a slow starter. At the end of episode one, I was left with the impression of a fairly mediocre show with an annoying female lead character that is poorly acted. However, one soon realizes that her restrained and unemotional manner is part of her character. Underneath this, Sofia Helin adds subtle nuances and complexity to her character that shows that she is a good actress. The plot also picks up and gets gradually more exciting and entertaining. Contrary to what others suggested, Kim Bodnia (who plays the danish cop) was actually very enthusiastic about this project and had nothing but praise for his female co-star. Needless to say, he is also very good in his role here.So my opinion is that this is a well made series with a complex and entertaining plot, interesting characters and good cinematography. On the negative side, some of the actors playing minor roles are sometimes less than stellar, the plot is far-fetched in places and the sound quality leaves some things to be desired in a few scenes. But with that said, Bron is a very good and well made series. Just make sure to give it a chance beyond the first couple of episodes or so before you decide what to think. Especially the main female character is somewhat unusual and requires some time to get a grasp of. But give it (and her) a chance and you won't regret it."

      "content": "So far (episode 3) \"Bron\" provides all the classic criminal genre elements with a modern and smart touch. The characters and actors fit their roles well (albeit being caricatures of the genre). I especially enjoy the humorous and feminist take on Saga Norén's character. For me all these little stylistic touches just add to the enjoyment. And the plot elements fit an interconnected Scandinavian/European reality without seeming overdone or simplified. I'd say this is one of the most exciting crime dramas of the decade, even since its function is not intended to be a long-running series with one main protagonist. I like the \"issues\" approach of \"Bron\" more than the classic European detective drama we've seen so far in the 2000s."
