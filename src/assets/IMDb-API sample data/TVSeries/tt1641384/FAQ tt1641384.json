      "question": "Is this show based on DC Comics' YOUNG JUSTICE comic book?",
      "answer": "Cartoon Network's Young Justice series is partially based on the 1998 comic-book series of the same name. The animated series is more of a composite between the original comic and DC's Teen Titans. The initial series line up consists of Robin/Dick Grayson, Kid Flash/Wally West, Aqualad, Superboy/Connor Kent, Miss Martian, and Artemis. Wonder Girl is among the characters who will be making a future appearance. The series is set on the world of Earth-16 within the DC Comics' Multiverse. The only real change when compared to the Young Justice comics is using Dick Grayson and Wally West as the Robin and Kid Flash in the series since they were the originals in the comics. Their replacements Tim Drake (Robin) and Bart Allen (Kid Flash, known as Impulse at the time) were the ones who were part of Young Justice in the comics, since at that point in the comics Dick had already become Nightwing and Wally had taken over his mentor's role as the Flash. Additionally Miss Martian is portrayed as Martian Manhunter's niece in the series, when she is actually a separate species of Martian in the comics called a white Martian who had transformed herself into a green Martian.Despite the change, this version of Dick Grayson does have some of Tim Drake's themes from the comics, such as the design of the Robin costume and Drake's computer techie capabilities.For Season 2 however which takes place 5 years later it does show Tim Drake and Bart Allen as part of the team as Robin and Impulse."
