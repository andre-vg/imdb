The fact that most of the ocean environment remains a mystery presented the production team with many challenges. Besides witnessing some animal behaviours for the first time, the crew also observed some that were new to science. The producers were helped by marine scientists all over the world with state-of-the-art equipment.\r\nBlue whales – whose migration routes were previously unknown – were located by air, after some of the animals had been given temporary radio tags. The camera team spent three years on standby, using a microlight to land on the water nearby when they finally caught up with the creatures in the Gulf of California. The open ocean proved more difficult and over 400 days were spent in often unsuccessful filming trips. After six weeks, the crew chanced upon a school of spinner dolphins, which in turn led them to a shoal of tuna. Off Mexico, the behaviour of a flock of frigatebirds guided the cameramen to a group of sailfish and marlin: the fastest inhabitants of the sea. Near the coast of Natal in South Africa, the team spent two seasons attempting to film the annual sardine run, a huge congregation of predators such as sharks and dolphins, that assembles to feast on the migrating fish by corralling them into \"bait balls\". Meanwhile, in Monterey Bay, orca were documented attacking gray whales and killing a calf. Filming in the deep ocean required the use of special submersibles. One of them enabled the crew to dive over a mile into the San Diego trench, where the carcass of a 40-ton gray whale had been placed to attract a large variety of scavengers.\r\nWhen first transmitted on BBC One, over 12 million people watched the series and it regularly achieved an audience share of over 30%.\r\nIn 2018 a newly-discovered species of phytoplankton (Syracosphaera azureaplaneta) was named by scientists in honour of the programme, and in recognition of David Attenborough's contribution to promoting wider understanding and awareness of the oceanic environment.\r\nEpisodes\r\n\"Our planet is a blue planet: over seventy percent of it is covered by the sea. The Pacific Ocean alone covers half the globe. You can fly across it non-stop for twelve hours and still see nothing more than a speck of land. This series will reveal the complete natural history of our ocean planet, from its familiar shores to the mysteries of its deepest seas.\"— David Attenborough, from episode one\r\nMerchandise\r\nDVD and Blu-ray\r\nThe series was available as a 3-disc DVD set (BBCDVD1089, released 3 December 2001 and re-released in 2003), including interviews with the production team, a photo gallery and three additional programmes:\r\nMaking Waves: the making of The Blue Planet (50 mins)\r\nDeep Trouble: an ecological documentary (50 mins)\r\nBlue: a five-minute theatrical short\r\nThe first DVD has now been superseded by a 4-disc Special Edition (BBCDVD1792, released 3 October 2005), which has three extra programmes:\r\nThe Abyss\r\nDive to Shark Volcano\r\nAmazon Abyss\r\nIn the US, there is a 4-disc Collector's Set edition (Released 2002), including 8 featurettes, interviews, photo galleries and one additional programmes:\r\nDeep Trouble: an ecological documentary (50 mins)\r\nIn the US, there is also a 5-disc Special Edition (BBC040754, released 6 May 2008). It contains the same features as the US 4-disc versions, but includes a fifth disk containing four special presentations:\r\nAmazon Abyss: discover an array of creatures living in the Amazon\r\nDive to Shark Volcano: venture to Cocoa Island, an underwater volcano\r\nBeneath the Tides: explore an estuary in winter\r\nAntarctica\r\nBBC released a 3-disc The Blue Planet: Seas of Life on Blu-ray on 9 April 2013. It contains the featured presentations as well as a third disk containing interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and five special presentations:\r\nAmazon Abyss\r\nDive to Shark Volcano\r\nBeneath the Tides\r\nAntarctica\r\nDeep Trouble.\r\nBooks\r\nThe accompanying book, The Blue Planet: A Natural History of the Oceans by Andrew Byatt, Alastair Fothergill and Martha Holmes (with a foreword by David Attenborough), was published by BBC Worldwide on 27 September 2001 (ISBN 0-563-38498-0).\r\nThe companion volume for the US market of the same book was published by Dorling Kindersley (DK) and released in 2002 (ISBN 0-789-48265-7).\r\nFilm\r\nDeep Blue is a 2003 nature documentary film that is a theatrical version of The Blue Planet. Alastair Fothergill and Andy Byatt are credited as directors, and six cinematographers are also credited. The film was premiered at the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain on 20 September 2003. It screened in more than 20 territories from 2003 to 2005 and grossed over $30 million at the box office.\r\nLive concert tour\r\nThe Blue Planet was turned into a theatrical presentation entitled The Blue Planet Live! which toured the UK from 2006 to 2008. The UK live shows were presented by World Class Service Ltd. George Fenton conducted the Manchester Camerata Orchestra in Manchester, Newcastle and Nottingham during December 2006, in three critically acclaimed shows. The tour continued in April 2007, again conducted by Fenton, in London, Cardiff, Birmingham and returning to Manchester and Nottingham.\r\nFor the show, some of the most spectacular sequences from the series have been edited together and are displayed on a huge screen (18 metres wide and 3 storeys high). The presentation is introduced by a special guest.\r\nThe tour continued in April 2008 with dates at Wembley Arena, Nottingham Arena, Manchester Central, Cardiff St. David's and Birmingham Symphony Hall.\r\nThe Blue Planet Live! continues to be staged:\r\non 7 May 2010 at the Morsani Hall of the Straz Center for the Performing Arts in Tampa, Florida performed by the Florida Orchestra and conducted by Ward Stare.\r\nin July 2011 in the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia performed by the Russian National Orchestra, narrator Jane Pauley\r\nin June 2012 in Singapore performed by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra\r\nin December 2014 in Abu Dhabi at Corniche performed by the National Symphony Orchestra\r\non 22 January 2015 in London at Royal Festival Hall, as a part of the Philharmonia at the Movies series.\r\nSequel\r\nIn February 2017, the BBC announced a seven-part sequel had been commissioned, titled Blue Planet II, with Sir David Attenborough returning as narrator and presenter. The sequel debuted on BBC One, BBC One HD and BBC Earth channel on 29 October 2017.\r\nOverseas\r\nThe series was sold to over 50 countries. In the United States, it was shown as The Blue Planet: Seas of Life with the episodes in a different order, the first one being retitled \"Ocean World\". The series was shown on the Discovery Channel and was narrated by Pierce Brosnan.\r\nAwards and nominations\r\nCriticism\r\nThe series attracted some criticism when it was revealed that some of the footage was filmed at an aquarium in Wales. The series producer, Alastair Fothergill, said that around 2% of the whole series was filmed in tanks at aquariums. A BBC spokesman argued that it would've been unethical to actually disturb the breeding process of wild lobsters for one of the scenes, which was why they made the decision to use the aquarium footage.",

Near a <span>Pacific</span> <span>seamount</span>, there is a large concentration of marine animals because when the current makes contact with the submerged rock, it forces upwards <span>plankton</span> and other organisms. This in turn attracts other fish to the area that are higher up the food chain, like tuna, and those that are higher still, such as <span>silky sharks</span>. Off South Africa, a similar situation occurs every June when <span>sardines</span> migrate and are pursued by a caravan of various predators. The <span>South Atlantic</span> waters are the roughest, and storms also churn up nutrients to the surface. These feeding grounds have led to the world's largest <span>albatross</span> breeding colony, on <span>Steeple Jason Island</span>, west of the <span>Falklands</span>. <span>Phytoplankton</span> forms the basis of all sea life, and every night some 1,000 million tonnes of creatures ascend from the deep to search for food. <span>Lunar phases</span> can also have a bearing on events and the mass arrival of <span>ridley sea turtles</span> on a <span>Costa Rican</span> beach is shown. <span>Herring</span> initiate the most productive food chain, providing sustenance for <span>humpback whales</span>, and <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Steller's</span> and <span>California sea lions</span>. In addition, their eggs are nutrition for many, both above and in the sea. Along the coast of California, a migrating <span>gray whale</span> and her calf are targeted by a pod of <span>orcas</span>, who hunt down and kill the calf. Meanwhile, another gray whale carcass has sunk to the bottom of the deep sea. Hagfish, a <span class=\"mw-redirect\">sleeper shark</span>, and other scavengers arrive to feast on the carcass, a valuable food source in the depths, where sustenance is almost always scarce. A year and a half later the carcass is stripped to the bone.</p><div class=\"thumb tright\"></div>This episode won an <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Emmy Award</span> for \"Outstanding Cinematography for Non-Fiction Programming\".

Over 60% of the sea is more than a mile deep and it forms the planet's most mysterious habitat. A <span>sperm whale</span> descends 1,000 metres to look for food and is followed, with the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Johnson Sealink</span> submersible. On the way down, a number of unusual creatures are witnessed, such as transparent <span>squid</span> and <span>jellies</span>, whose <span>photophores</span> give pulsating displays of colour. In such dark places, both being able to see (or sense movement) and the means of quick concealment are equally desirable. To that end, some use <span>bioluminescence</span> as a means of detecting food or evading predators. A descent to the very bottom of the ocean – some 4,000 metres – reveals life even at such cold temperatures, much of it new to science. It is dominated by <span>echinoderms</span> that sweep the sea bed; however, there are occasional large hunters, such as <span>chimaera</span>. In addition, <span>sixgill sharks</span> can grow up to eight metres in length and have remained unchanged for 150 million years. They are described as \"living fossils\" and relatively little is known about them. The remains of a gray whale are filmed being consumed by hagfish, a sleeper shark, probably a <span>Greenland sleeper</span> or a <span>Pacific sleeper</span> and the submersible involved in filming this is <span>DSV Alvin</span>, which is the same submersible that <span>Robert Ballard</span> used in 1986 to explore the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">wreck of the <i>Titanic</i></span>, as acrylic sphere submersibles cannot reach that depth. As the <span>continental slope</span> flattens out, it joins the <span>abyssal plain</span>, which can form huge trenches. At seven miles, the deepest is the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Mariana trench</span>, and fish have been found there right down to the very bottom. Attenborough remarks that more is known about the surface of the <span>moon</span>. Species captured on film for the first time include the <span>Dumbo octopus</span> and the <span>hairy anglerfish</span>.</p><div class=\"thumb tright\"></div>This episode was nominated for two <span>Emmy Award</span> for Outstanding Sound Editing and Outstanding Sound Mixing in the non-fiction category.

Such waters contain the swiftest and most powerful of ocean hunters. A feeding frenzy is shown, as <span>striped marlin</span>, tuna and a <span>sei whale</span> (later identified as a <span>Bryde's whale</span>) pick off a shoal of sardines until all within it have been consumed. <span>Manta rays</span> also gather to eat the eggs of spawning <span>surgeonfish</span>. Accumulations of plankton correspond to ocean 'boundaries' and consequently, schools of fish seek them out. This in turn attracts predators, and a <span>sailfish</span> is filmed on the attack. The only escape for smaller fish is to put as much distance between them and their pursuers as possible. <span>Bluefin tuna</span> are able to heat their bodies and so can hunt in colder conditions than the others of their species. Off the coast of <span>New Zealand</span>, an undersea <span>volcano</span> has formed an island and the nearby currents sweep many kinds of creatures to it, again creating huge feeding grounds. Another Pacific seamount is surrounded by <span>hammerhead sharks</span>, but not to seek food: they are there to allow other fish to clean them of <span>parasites</span>. However, others that are on the lookout for prey arrive in vast numbers. A large pod of <span>common dolphins</span> is too big to feed all at once and so splits up into smaller expeditions. One of these ends up near the <span>Azores</span> with a shoal of <span>mackerel</span> in its sights, but they have to compete for their quarry with an attendant flock of <span>shearwaters</span> and a group of adult <span>yellowfin tuna</span>.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep4\" style=\"text-align:center\">4</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Frozen Seas\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">4 October 2001</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">12.10</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #2998FF\"><div class=\"thumb tleft\"></div> <div class=\"thumb tleft\"></div>This episode compares oceanic life in the <span>Arctic</span> and <span>Antarctica</span>. The winter in these regions brings temperatures of minus 50 °C and frozen seas that create the biggest challenge. However, there are <span>polynyas</span> in the Arctic, which are free of ice owing to the pressure of currents on either side, and such places do provide refuge for some species, like the <span>walrus</span> and the <span>bowhead whale</span>. A pod of <span class=\"mw-redirect\">belugas</span> is shown: their movements are limited to a single hole in the ice – therefore putting them at risk of attack from <span>polar bears</span>. Everything changes with the arrival of summer, when melting ice brings a variety of migratory visitors. At the other end of the planet, in the Antarctic, winter is even more harsh, but <span>emperor penguins</span> and <span>Weddell seals</span> stay throughout. Under the sea ice, <span>krill</span> shrink in size and revert to their juvenile form in order to save energy. <span>Chinstrap penguins</span> overwinter to the north, beyond the ice, but return during the spring to breed. Having managed to get ashore, they have to walk a great distance to find a nest site, and the most favoured is <span>Zavodovski Island</span>, an active volcano whose warmth keeps ice from forming. Further south, as the sea ice breaks up, humpback and <span>minke whales</span> appear, their target the abundant krill. The <span>leopard seal</span> is the Antarctic's top predator. It is most effective underwater, and emperor penguins propel themselves at speed through its territory. Nonetheless, it almost invariably makes a kill.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep5\" style=\"text-align:center\">5</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Seasonal Seas\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10 October 2001</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">9.75</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #2998FF\">The fifth instalment surveys the effects of the <span>seasons</span> on the world's temperate seas – the most productive on Earth. <span>Sable Island</span> near <span>Nova Scotia</span> boasts the largest colony of <span>grey seals</span>, which breed there when the weather is at its worst. The pups remain marooned for weeks until the spring, when they are strong enough to swim. Spring also heralds the bloom of phytoplankton: it provides food for <span>copepods</span>, and they in turn are prey to jellyfish, which assemble in vast, million-strong swarms. On the <span>Californian</span> coast, <span>giant kelp</span> also flourishes and by summer, grows at the rate of a metre a day. It provides a sanctuary for shoals of fish and <span>sea otters</span>, the latter anchoring themselves to the <span>seaweed</span> when resting and keeping its grazers in check by eating them. Late summer in <span>Alaska</span> sees <span>Pacific salmon</span> heading inshore to breed. However, the level of their favoured river is too low and they are forced to wait in the open sea, where they fall prey to a <span>salmon shark</span>. The early autumn near <span>Vancouver Island</span>, and the temperature drops slowly. There, the last of the year's baby herring become the focus for a feeding frenzy by diving <span>auks</span> and <span>murres</span>, and marauding <span class=\"mw-redirect\">rockfish</span>. <span>Pacific white-sided dolphins</span> also inhabit these waters and, when not hunting nocturnally, socialise during the day. As winter arrives in the north, adult herring seek shelter but are hunted by orca, which club the fish with their tails to subdue them by creating waves of pressure.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep6\" style=\"text-align:center\">6</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Coral Seas\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">17 October 2001</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">9.80</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #2998FF\"><span>Coral reefs</span>, which are so crowded that they play host to a perpetual battle for space, even among the <span>coral</span> itself. It starts life as a larva that becomes a <span>polyp</span>. Having multiplied, it hardens into a <span>limestone</span> skeleton and grows to form a reef. As the community flourishes, animals develop relationships with one another and such a place can feature a huge variety of ocean life. Although corals feed nocturnally on plankton, sunlight is vital because even though they are animals, each contains millions of single-celled <span>algae</span>. This in turn is the favoured sustenance of the <span>humphead parrotfish</span>, whose jaws are so powerful that it erodes much of the reef into fine sand. Algae also grows on the top of the reef and a battle for grazing rights between shoals of <span>powder blue</span> and <span>convict tangs</span> is shown, the former being initially overwhelmed by the latter's weight of numbers before regaining the upper hand. The night-time hunting of a <span>marbled ray</span> alerts other predators and a group of <span>whitetip reef sharks</span> moves in, from which few are safe. Several breeding strategies are examined, including the acrobatic habits of brown surgeonfish and the colourful courtship of the <span>flamboyant cuttlefish</span>.

These are caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting <span>moon</span>, but in some locations, this can also combine with the power of the sun to create a <span>tidal bore</span>. The world's largest tides are to be found in the <span>Bay of Fundy</span> in Nova Scotia and therefore it is a rich feeding ground. A school of <span>finback whales</span> is closely shadowed by a flock of <span>Cory's shearwaters</span>. However, they only have a limited time to feed before low tide, when they must retreat and other creatures appear. Elsewhere, some of the latter include <span>sand bubbler crabs</span>, <span>bears</span> (which feed on <span>shellfish</span>) and a <span>snail</span> species that can 'surf', and some <span>sand lances</span> being preyed on by <span>dogfish sharks</span>. The extreme spring tides allow opportunists to forage further, and <span>raccoons</span> are shown tackling a <span>red rock crab</span>. Some larger fish that hunt on the seabed, such as <span>nurse sharks</span> and <span>stingrays</span>, are forced to sit and wait until there is sufficient water in which to swim. A <span class=\"mw-redirect\">giant horse conch</span> is shown devouring a <span class=\"mw-redirect\">tulip snail</span>, and <span>hermit crabs</span> battle over its vacant shell.

The autumn <span>equinox</span> combines with a <span class=\"mw-redirect\">hurricane</span> off the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Bahamas</span> to create a much higher tide than is usual, flooding large parts of the coast.

The perils of living in such places are highlighted by <span>marine iguanas</span> on the <span>Galápagos Islands</span>, whose diet of seaweed is quickly grabbed between crashing breakers. Many shores provide sites in which to breed or lay eggs. Apart from <span>birds</span>, <span>turtles</span> are among other major species to do so, and the mass emergence of <span class=\"mw-redirect\">flatbacks</span> on <span>Crab Island</span> in Australia is reduced by predatory <span>night herons</span>, <span>pelicans</span> and other hunters. Each year, four million seabirds, comprising fourteen species, return to the island of <span>Talan</span> in eastern Russia to nest. By ensuring that all their chicks eventually leave at the same time, they lessen the impact of predators. The rough seas of the <span>Southern Ocean</span> play host to <span>penguins</span>, and a group of them is shown being pursued by an aggressive bull <span>sea lion</span>. The planet's coldest seas are in Antarctica, and on <span class=\"mw-redirect\">South Georgia</span> each spring, thousands of <span>southern elephant seals</span> arrive to breed. A pair of males is shown fighting a bloody battle to control a harem of females, and Attenborough states that these fights, which are rarely fatal, can go on for 20 minutes or longer. In <span>Patagonia</span>, the social nature of sea lions is shown as they establish colonies, each of them several hundred strong. While in some respects it is an ideal location for the growing young, high tide brings danger for the colony as a pod of <span>orcas</span> habitually goes on the attack. After intentionally grounding themselves to catch their prey, the orcas return to the sea with their quarries to 'play' with them, before ultimately consuming their kills.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"epSpecials\" style=\"text-align:center\">Specials</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Deep Trouble\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">28 October 2001</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><small style=\"color: #2C2C2C\" title=\"N/A\">N/A</small></td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #2998FF\">Scientists believe many species that are eaten every day are now seriously threatened.

The series producer, Alastair Fothergill, said that around 2% of the whole series was filmed in tanks at aquariums. A BBC spokesman argued that it would've been unethical to actually disturb the breeding process of wild lobsters for one of the scenes, which was why they made the decision to use the aquarium footage.</p><br/>"
