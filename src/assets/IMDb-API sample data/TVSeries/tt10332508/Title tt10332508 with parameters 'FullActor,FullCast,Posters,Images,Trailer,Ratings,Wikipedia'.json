The show has won three Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation Juried Awards from the Emmy for Storyboard Artist (Genndy Tartakovsky), Art Director (Scott Wills), and Character Designer (Stephen DeStefano).\r\nPremise\r\nSet in an anachronistic and fantastical prehistoric world, the premise is a bond between a Neanderthal named Spear and a female Tyrannosaurus rex named Fang as they struggle to survive, encountering various dangerous fauna and people that live in their world while also encountering different creatures and Iron Age homo sapiens.\r\nCharacters\r\nIn comparison to Tartakovsky's other shows where there are multiple characters, Primal initially only features Spear and Fang in the show as they encounter different prehistoric or fantastical species and various tribes of hominins. Tartakovsky stated that although the show is a work of fantasy, the prehistoric animals, modern creatures and futuristic beasts in the show are based on real prehistoric animals, as well as some new ones created by the artists involved in the project.\r\nMain\r\nSpear (voiced by Aaron LaPlante; Noah Bentley (young)) – A Neanderthal whose mate and two children are attacked and devoured by a pack of horned Tyrannosaurs. Although he overcomes his initial urge to commit suicide, Spear is still learning to cope with the loss. Eventually, he develops a deep bond with Fang and is willing to make any personal sacrifice to protect her. (Seasons 1–2)\r\nFang – A teal female Tyrannosaurus whose hatchlings are killed by the same horned Tyrannosaur pack that killed Spear's family. Unlike Spear, who is still traumatized and dealing with the loss of his loved ones, Fang is able to cope with hers much quicker. Initially, she attempts to assert her dominance over Spear but eventually learns that it is far healthier to work in a partnership and is willing to do anything to ensure his survival. (Seasons 1–2)\r\nMira (voiced by Laëtitia Eïdo) – A virtuous Arabic-speaking human. Enslaved and branded with a scorpion symbol by a Viking clan, Mira escapes and encounters Spear and Fang, who become her new friends and companions. She proves to be very capable with archery, spears, axes, carpentry, helmsmanship, and cooking. (season 2; guest: season 1)\r\nCharles (voiced by Jacob Dudman) – A scientist and member of the Historical Society who theorizes about the correlation between the primitive and modern man. (\"The Primal Theory\")\r\nDarlington (voiced by Jeremy Crutchley) – An English scientist and former boxing champion whose manor hosts a Historical Society of well-educated scientists. (\"The Primal Theory\")\r\nRecurring\r\nSeason 1\r\nSpear's family – Spear's mate, son, and daughter that were eaten by a pack of horned Tyrannosaurs in the first episode, but reappear through visions and flashbacks across the series.\r\nFang's first brood – Fang's first two hatchlings. Like Spear's family, they were eaten in the first episode, but reappear through visions and flashbacks across the series.\r\nSeason 2\r\nThe Chieftain (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) – The chieftain of the Viking tribe responsible for abducting Mira's people. He soon seeks revenge on Spear and Fang for decimating his tribe. Following his son Eldar's death, the Chieftain is transformed into a monstrous, fiery giant by the demonic entity in order to kill Spear and Fang in exchange for Eldar's soul.\r\nEldar (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) – The Chieftain's eldest son. He joins his father on their quest for revenge against Spear and Fang for their tribe's destruction.\r\nDemonic Entity – The lord of the fiery underworld who makes a deal with the Chieftain to have him kill Spear and Fang and bring him their souls in exchange for Eldar's soul.\r\nIma (voiced by Amina Koroma) – A tyrannical and ruthless Egyptian queen who resides in a large city-ship called the Colossaeus filled with her warriors and slaves that she uses to raid and loot other kingdoms.\r\nKamau (voiced by Imari Williams) – A giant African man who, while naturally peaceful, is also immensely strong and was enslaved by Ima along with his similarly-sized tribe. It is revealed that Ima is holding his daughter Amal hostage, which serves as leverage to force him to obey her.\r\nAmal (voiced by Hillary Hawkins) – Kamau's daughter.\r\nFang's second brood – Fang's second set of hatchlings that were born after she mated with a Tyrannosaurus named Red. While one was killed before hatching, the other two live to adulthood.\r\nProduction\r\nConception and development\r\nAccording to Tartakovsky, Primal was an early piece of work he scrapped because it did not click with him at the time. As he learned more and more about what drew people in to his shows, he wanted to experiment with those artistic traits, particularly the use of no dialogue and slow moments.

He said he was inspired by Conan the Barbarian and vintage pulp novels, as well as films such as The Revenant. Tartakovsky felt that people would not take the show seriously because they were \"breaking the rules\" by having \"a man and a dinosaur together,\" so he emphasized that it is a character study, a \"buddies\" journey about two characters who are very different but bonded by tragedy.\r\nThe first season consists of 10 episodes.

      "html": "<p>Primal (also known as Genndy Tartakovsky's Primal) is an American adult animated action horror television series created and directed by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network's night-time programming block Adult Swim. It is the first horror television series from Cartoon Network Studios and Williams Street.</p><p>Primal is set in an anachronistic vision of prehistory, portraying dinosaurs, hominids, and other creatures as coexisting within the same time period and incorporating many elements of fantasy, horror, action, and adventure. The first two seasons revolve around the journey of Spear (Aaron LaPlante), a caveman, and Fang, a female Tyrannosaurus rex, who each lose their families and decide to partner up to survive their unforgiving environment together, eventually discovering developed civilizations that they end up in conflict with. The series has no dialogue throughout its first season, before incorporating minimal dialogue in the second season, in line with Tartakovsky's previous work.</p><p>The first 10-episode season of Primal was split into two 5-episode parts. The series premiered on Adult Swim on October 8, 2019, with the remaining episodes releasing daily that same week. The second half of the season premiered one episode April 1, 2020, with the remaining episodes premiering weekly for the five weeks following October 4, 2020. In August 2020, the series was renewed for a 10-episode second season, which premiered July 22 and concluded September 16, 2022. Following the second season finale and conclusion of Spear and Fang's storyline, Tartakovsky confirmed that Primal would become an anthology series from its forthcoming third season onward.</p><p>Primal has received widespread critical acclaim, with much praise for its animation, storytelling, music, emotional depth, horror elements, and editing. The show has won three Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation Juried Awards from the Emmy for Storyboard Artist (Genndy Tartakovsky), Art Director (Scott Wills), and Character Designer (Stephen DeStefano).</p><br/><h3>Premise</h3><p>Set in an anachronistic and fantastical prehistoric world, the premise is a bond between a Neanderthal named Spear and a female Tyrannosaurus rex named Fang as they struggle to survive, encountering various dangerous fauna and people that live in their world while also encountering different creatures and Iron Age homo sapiens.</p><br/><h3>Characters</h3><p>In comparison to Tartakovsky's other shows where there are multiple characters, Primal initially only features Spear and Fang in the show as they encounter different prehistoric or fantastical species and various tribes of hominins. Tartakovsky stated that although the show is a work of fantasy, the prehistoric animals, modern creatures and futuristic beasts in the show are based on real prehistoric animals, as well as some new ones created by the artists involved in the project.</p><h4>Main</h4><ul><li>Spear (voiced by Aaron LaPlante; Noah Bentley (young)) – A Neanderthal whose mate and two children are attacked and devoured by a pack of horned Tyrannosaurs. Although he overcomes his initial urge to commit suicide, Spear is still learning to cope with the loss. Eventually, he develops a deep bond with Fang and is willing to make any personal sacrifice to protect her. (Seasons 1–2)</li><li>Fang – A teal female Tyrannosaurus whose hatchlings are killed by the same horned Tyrannosaur pack that killed Spear's family. Unlike Spear, who is still traumatized and dealing with the loss of his loved ones, Fang is able to cope with hers much quicker. Initially, she attempts to assert her dominance over Spear but eventually learns that it is far healthier to work in a partnership and is willing to do anything to ensure his survival. (Seasons 1–2)</li><li>Mira (voiced by Laëtitia Eïdo) – A virtuous Arabic-speaking human. Enslaved and branded with a scorpion symbol by a Viking clan, Mira escapes and encounters Spear and Fang, who become her new friends and companions. She proves to be very capable with archery, spears, axes, carpentry, helmsmanship, and cooking. (season 2; guest: season 1)</li><li>Charles (voiced by Jacob Dudman) – A scientist and member of the Historical Society who theorizes about the correlation between the primitive and modern man. (\"The Primal Theory\")</li><li>Darlington (voiced by Jeremy Crutchley) – An English scientist and former boxing champion whose manor hosts a Historical Society of well-educated scientists. (\"The Primal Theory\")</li></ul><h4>Recurring</h4><h4>Season 1</h4><ul><li>Spear's family – Spear's mate, son, and daughter that were eaten by a pack of horned Tyrannosaurs in the first episode, but reappear through visions and flashbacks across the series.</li><li>Fang's first brood – Fang's first two hatchlings. Like Spear's family, they were eaten in the first episode, but reappear through visions and flashbacks across the series.</li></ul><h4>Season 2</h4><ul><li>The Chieftain (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) – The chieftain of the Viking tribe responsible for abducting Mira's people. He soon seeks revenge on Spear and Fang for decimating his tribe. Following his son Eldar's death, the Chieftain is transformed into a monstrous, fiery giant by the demonic entity in order to kill Spear and Fang in exchange for Eldar's soul.</li><li>Eldar (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) – The Chieftain's eldest son. He joins his father on their quest for revenge against Spear and Fang for their tribe's destruction.</li><li>Demonic Entity – The lord of the fiery underworld who makes a deal with the Chieftain to have him kill Spear and Fang and bring him their souls in exchange for Eldar's soul.</li><li>Ima (voiced by Amina Koroma) – A tyrannical and ruthless Egyptian queen who resides in a large city-ship called the Colossaeus filled with her warriors and slaves that she uses to raid and loot other kingdoms.</li><li>Kamau (voiced by Imari Williams) – A giant African man who, while naturally peaceful, is also immensely strong and was enslaved by Ima along with his similarly-sized tribe. It is revealed that Ima is holding his daughter Amal hostage, which serves as leverage to force him to obey her.</li><li>Amal (voiced by Hillary Hawkins) – Kamau's daughter.</li><li>Fang's second brood – Fang's second set of hatchlings that were born after she mated with a Tyrannosaurus named Red. While one was killed before hatching, the other two live to adulthood.</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Conception and development</h4><p>According to Tartakovsky, Primal was an early piece of work he scrapped because it did not click with him at the time. As he learned more and more about what drew people in to his shows, he wanted to experiment with those artistic traits, particularly the use of no dialogue and slow moments. He also stated that the method in which he approached animated projects began to slow down in terms of energy, and by the time he finished working on Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation , it had come full circle. He said he was inspired by Conan the Barbarian and vintage pulp novels, as well as films such as The Revenant. Tartakovsky felt that people would not take the show seriously because they were \"breaking the rules\" by having \"a man and a dinosaur together,\" so he emphasized that it is a character study, a \"buddies\" journey about two characters who are very different but bonded by tragedy.</p><p>The first season consists of 10 episodes. On August 31, 2020, the series was renewed for a second season which consists of 10 episodes.</p><br/><h3>Episodes</h3><h4>Series overview</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr style=\"text-align:center\"><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"min-width:50px;padding:0 8px\">Season</th><th scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding:0 8px\">Episodes</th><th scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\">Originally released</th></tr><tr><th scope=\"col\">First released</th><th scope=\"col\">Last released</th></tr><tr style=\"height:100%\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" style=\"height:inherit;padding:0\"><span style=\"text-align:center;float:left;width:100%;height:100%\"><span style=\"height:100%;width:calc(100% - 14px - 8px);display:flex;vertical-align:middle;align-items:center;justify-content:center;padding:0 4px\"><span class=\"nowrap\"><span>1</span></span></span></span></th><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\">10</td><td colspan=\"1\">5</td><td colspan=\"1\" style=\"padding:0.2em 0.4em\">October 8, 2019</td><td style=\"padding:0 8px\">October 12, 2019</td></tr><tr style=\"height:100%\"><td colspan=\"1\">5</td><td colspan=\"1\" style=\"padding:0.2em 0.4em\">October 4, 2020</td><td style=\"padding:0 8px\">November 1, 2020</td></tr><tr style=\"height:100%\"><th scope=\"row\" colspan=\"1\" style=\"height:inherit;padding:0\"><span style=\"text-align:center;float:left;width:100%;height:100%\"><span style=\"height:100%;width:calc(100% - 14px - 8px);display:flex;vertical-align:middle;align-items:center;justify-content:center;padding:0 4px\"><span class=\"nowrap\"><span>2</span></span></span></span></th><td colspan=\"2\">10</td><td colspan=\"1\" style=\"padding:0.2em 0.4em\">July 22, 2022</td><td style=\"padding:0 8px\">September 16, 2022</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Season 1 (2019–20)</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr style=\"color:white;text-align:center\"><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#414e56;width:5%\"><abbr title=\"Number\">No.</abbr><br>overall</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#414e56;width:5%\"><abbr title=\"Number\">No.</abbr> in<br>season</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#414e56\">Title</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#414e56\">Written and storyboarded by</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#414e56\">Story by</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#414e56\">Original air date <span style=\"background-color:white;padding:1px;display:inline-block;line-height:50%\"></span></th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#414e56;width:10%\">U.S. viewers<br>(millions)</th></tr><tr><td colspan=\"13\" id=\"Part_1\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color:#414e56;color:white\"><b>Part 1</b></td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep1\" style=\"text-align:center\">1</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Spear and Fang\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><span>Genndy Tartakovsky</span></td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Tartakovsky</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">October 8, 2019</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0.538</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #414e56\">A <span>Neanderthal</span> named Spear returns from a fishing trip to find his mate, son, and daughter devoured by a trio of red, horned <span>Tyrannosaurs</span>.
