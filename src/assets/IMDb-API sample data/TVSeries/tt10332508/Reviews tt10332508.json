Two species fighting for their lives and each other bound by circumstance created in such a way that entertaining , powerful and richly drawn with rich hues of saturated prime colors. I'm going to be saddened knowing it will end. Since the days of Dexters Lab to Samurai Jack i have enjoyed the creators style, this I hope brings more for us to enjoy on the fringe. Thank You Mr. Tartakovsky for your stellar work."

It was beyond amazing, the perfect teamwork between Spear (The cavman) and Fang (The Dinosaur) going on adventures to hunt, kill and survive through many deadly prehistoric creatures that can kill anything or anyone. This is one of the best things Genndy Tartakovsky has ever done. Now it can wait for another episode tomorrow night at midnight! And then, I'll also wait for Hotel Transylvania 4. I give Primal a 9.5/10"

There's a drifting central narrative, but much like Samurai Jack it's split into different episodic meditations on genre. You know the fare, epic battles, heart-breaking asides, disturbing encounters, stunning set-pieces. It's a fantastic watch but what makes it really special is the art direction - the use of colour is iconic and stunning, the character design is incredible and the landscapes can be legitimately breath-taking. Sometimes I just paused the show to drink it all in. It's just pure art basically and if you're even remotely interested in animation then get this into your eyes and mind. Cannot wait for more."

Not only is it beautifully animated which makes every battle scene stand out and be visceral, but it does so much more to appeal to our internal emotions solely by the expressions on the characters' faces and their movements, without really humanizing anything. It reminds you that in this harsh world, to live is to eat, and to eat is to kill. The art style is gorgeous as well, with its world rich with subtle details to make it feel alive. The score for this hits a balance between something eerie and organic, with a bit of drums added in which adds to the tension during chases and whatnot.This show is a gem. Please go see it and voice your support so we (hopefully) get to see more like this."

The sound design, shots and animations are simply amazing, I was completely stunned: the tension in some scenes, the develop of the friendship between the animal and the human being and the design of other creatures. Everything is well balanced and you can really bound with main characters.Genndy Tartakovsky made another amazing product, and I understand immediately why I fell in love with this serie: when I was a child, I used to be a big fan of Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls and Samurai Jack. Of course I just found out that he was the creator of all these series. It is a small gem. If you want to watch quality stuff, I highly recommend this show."

The show definitely views nature as 'red in tooth' as various creatures, including the heroes' off-spring, get decapitated, bit in two, or messily devoured by a variety of prehistoric carnivores. There is no script beyond grunting, roaring, or screaming but series creator Genndy Tartakovsky manages to bring a lot of personality to his voiceless yet engaging characters (both man and beast). The physics are as unrealistic as the paleo-biology, but viewers willing to suspend their disbelief will be rewarded with entertaining stories and a rich, somewhat surreal, depiction of an alternative primeval Earth."

Finally a show that pushes you to watch rather than to listen to a bunch of babbling. I'm urging everyone to watch it, I'm going to show it to my friends that \"dont like cartoons\" so they can see that when done right, animation can almost be more powerful at conveying emotion than film. It hasn't been out long but I think that this show will go down in history and stick in our minds for years to come. Quite nothing like it. Not one bad thing to say at all."

      "title": "A masterpiece of animation",
      "content": "Man, Genndy Tartakovsky is a true animation master. Pretty much everything he touches is a masterpiece, and this show, Primal (2019) is no exception. It borrows a lot from Tartakovsky's most popular show, Samurai Jack. They both don't have that much dialogue, and both have a lot of action, drama, and heart.This show involves a caveman named Spear, whose family gets killed by dinosaur. He meets another dinosaur named Fang. They can't stand each other at first, but as the episodes go on, they start to care deeply for each other and they become true friends. It is one of the most well-crafted friendship stories in animation, and the ending of episode 5. Good Lord, the ending. Poor, poor Spear......One major element of the show is that there is no dialogue, only visuals and music. When something does come out of the characters' mouths, it's only grunts and yells. This helps to establish the show's setting. This show is about dinosaurs, and obviously dinosaurs can't talk, and cavemen weren't advanced enough to talk normally, so the lack of dialogue is justified. It's also a great example of \"show, don't tell\", as the visuals and music convey the tone in ways dialogue never could.There is a lot of blood in the show, so be warned if you're squeamish of blood. Other than that, I think Big Kidsâ„¢ with a lot of patience should be able to handle it. I definitely recommend it. If you think all modern cartoons are trash, watch this show and your mind will be changed."

Primal is brutal, with almost every episode the necessary slashing and violent killings, which you would expect in a time where surviving is the only thing you're worried about. Primal is primitive, there's no talking except some grunting, and that's exactly what makes this series great. Primal is animation for adults that like something different for once. Great job from Genndy Tartakovsky and the whole animation team."

But anyway!Like fair enough of course not everyone is into hardcore realistic violence, but that doesn't give you the slightest grounds to say the show is 1/10 on that basis alone. It's a non review.That out of the way, I rate this show 10 out of 10. And I mean that. I loved every minute of this show, that does what hollywood can't and without any dialogue. You get to know Spear and Fang over time and see their relationship and trust develop. They are complicated characters too, somehow even though they never speak.Anyways I loved it I was hooked, it's so visceral and yet beautiful. I can say that I'm a huge Tartakovsky fan so I'm biased admittedly."

I simply wanted to be accurate & fairly critical in my assessment of the show.Well, Primal is like nothing ever made before; it's brutal & savage yet heart-melting & gushes with emotions at the same time, it's crazy yet filled with wisdom at the same time, it's fast & abundant with action without a single doll moment yet suspenseful at the same time, it can be perceived as an animated documentary yet it's also filled with fantasy & imagination at the same time... BOTTOM LINE: I have never (and I literally & sincerely mean \"never\") seen anything more beautiful & powerful than this animation; not a TV series, not a movie, not an anime, nothing!!!I'm a huge fan and I love the usual inspiring magical popular animations like \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\", etc --- but still; this is something else... I cannot find the words to describe how much I adore it and how much I'm fascinated by it; you just have to watch it and judge for yourself.The script is written superbly in a way that will make you empathize & sympathize with the main characters limitlessly, to the degree of swaying you and changing your psyche & preconceived thoughts! It made me hate the Vikings and the ancient Egyptians for their ruthlessness & selfishness, especially regarding their enslaving other peoples (and I'm someone who was addicted to the TV series Vikings!), and it made me love the name Mira and her Lebanese/Phoenician culture, language & roots, and it made me wish I had a dinosaur for a pet/best-friend!And I really have enjoyed getting brain-washed like that! LolJUST WATCH THE DAMN THING (if you still haven't), and thank me later."

      "content": "Bang on from the very first scene and what a beautiful first scene that is. The animation and the sounds are wonderfully done. Kudos to the team. Love the brutality, the struggles, the bare truths. A wonderful watch. A serious film about a stone age man and his struggle for survival as he bonds with a dinosaur. A film without any dialogues & could be a tad much for kids."
