      "question": "What is the meaning of the name \"Peaky Blinders\"?",
      "answer": "The original Peaky Blinders gang was a real early 1900's gang from Birmingham. The origins of their name are unknown, but there are two popular theories - one states that the gang members stitched razor blades to the inside of their flat caps. This iconic flat cap was also called a \"peaky\", and when they headbutted someone in a fight wearing one, it could cause blindness.However, according to the Birmingham Mail, that story is most likely an invention, since disposable razor blades weren't invented till much later. They give the reason for the \"blinders\" name as merely being popular slang for someone who blinds with their dashing appearance."
