I binged the entire series as quickly as I could and I would dare to bet you would to if you haven't seen it yet. It takes a look at the lives of the women inmates and the staff at Wentworth prison. This show is intense, violent, gritty, intelligent, all of those. It's a pretty if cast and there's not a weak link among them. They all do a fantastic job. I can not recommend this show enough. Give it a chance and I promise you won't be disappointed."

It's a lot like Game of Thrones where no character is safe no matter who they are. Some of biggest characters on the show will die or leave but the quality stays the same season after season!"

I do think a spin off series on lou Kelly's first prison sentence is definitely needed and on why boomer didn't trust her. One character I didn't get the point in was Judy Bryant, that was just a pointless story and it's a shame they made Ruby's character weak. You always knew when a top dog was going to die as they were tired and fed up. They killed reds character off to early as well. A lot could have been done with her!!!"

The casting and acting is out of this world. Each of the seasons finales are staggering. I've watched all 3 seasons and each is a prize waiting to behold. This series is brilliant. The way the lead has grown and transgressed is so awesome. I love this show. Orange is the new black I can't even watch after I first saw this. It literally changed the game.

      "title": "Wentworth, worth all it's weight in watchability",
      "content": "Looking back now, Prisoner was a laugh riot. Dad and I were laughing when they repeated the original series, again, that seems so cheesy now, if of course unrealistic, judging by the larger than life plots, and some highly and insanely unlikely scenarios, that caused a bit of eye rolling. Oh, how times have changed. This new, better series is more modernized as now having security cameras with much better looking women and better actors, although the ones from the original must be praised too. Don't fault them, it's what they had to work with. We retain our chief characters from the original, though some, altered, here and there, especially Vera 'Vinegar Tits' Bennett, played wonderfully by a familiar Seachange face. Danielle McCormack holds her own, very strong as Bea, and a much hotter looking Frankie Doyle, is a very animated and absorbing character, wonderfully played by De Silva, up there by McCormack. Even the brief Jim Fletcher character is reprised by McCleod's Daughter's Aaron Jeffrey. But it's Pamela Rabe as the notorious Joan Ferguson, who's really scarring and creepy to the max. I was impressed and admired her take on the role, that's so creepily haunting, I prefer her to Maggie's Kirkpatrick's portrayal. It's great to see different actors do the same role, putting their own spin on it. Hey if they copied the other actors, it would be boring, and unwatchable, but when actors breath a lot of originality, life and traits into that role, you know it will be, and I'm not just saying that about Rabe's, but her performance was the one, who had the real effect on me, that sly smile, and those unreadable expressions in that steel gaze of hers, that only leaves you wanting more. This is one of those successful remakes, a much scarier and tougher Prisoner this time around, some women you don't want to mess with, the much younger ones, some real cuties. Hey, if you want laughs and escapism, just go back to the original, as this one, a much more serious and intense series, is far different from what went on 24 years earlier. Excellento."

It's definitely one of my favourite TV shows right now and I'm glad it has already been renewed for a 5th series at least.The basic premise is the life of the inmates but after watching a few episodes you soon realise its much deeper than that. We see their lives inside and out as well as the prison guards who all add something a little different.The main characters all have strong development as the series goes on so it's important that you find some of the characters likable as you will certainly be learning a lot about them. The Freak is one of the greatest TV villains of all time & Bea is a character that we see evolve massively. The supporting characters are all great too.All of the story lines are captivating and most of the time I didn't want the episodes to end, I would usually watch 3 in one sitting. Each season seems to have one main story line but there is always something different going on elsewhere as well. Sometimes its shockingly violent but sometimes we just see the characters having a laugh. The tone of the show can change at any given moment.There is plenty of twists and turns as characters come and go and relationships are ever changing to the point where nobody knows who to trust.Overall I really liked the story lines and each character brought something unique to the show. Would recommend everyone to give this a chance. 10/10, top show."

But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner contemporizing legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This ten-part series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment exploring the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire."

      "content": "I was a huge fan of the first season of Wentworth Prison when it was shown on Channel 5 in the UK last year. I thought the series proved to be a great 'standalone' drama with high quality production values, excellent writing and acting. The series at the same time also paid subtle and gracious homage to Prisoner, a special and ground breaking show. Well the second season doesn't disappoint, building on the quality of the first season, and it is mostly down to the clever introduction into the Wentworth mix of one character - Joan Ferguson. Pamela Rabe is simply brilliant as Joan Ferguson - taking on the mantle of one of the most iconic of TV characters and breathing a new 21st century life into her is no easy job, but Rabe achieves it, obviously relishing the opportunity to play such an unusual female character. Rabe's on screen presence, controlled physical stillness and a real glint in the eye hides an obvious wealth of feelings, which comes out in small doses throughout the season, in carefully played scenes where unexpected kindness and sincerity adds real depth to an already complicated individual. The 'new' Joan Ferguson has obvious OCD and abhors physical contact. Her compulsion to control every part of her environment (including her office) her staff and prisoners is wonderfully realised by Rabe, with a series of subtle physical ticks, cold stares and calculating mental games with everyone around her. Great use is made of prison security cameras which become Joan's 'All seeing eye'. Clever adaption of surgical gloves is used as a visual tease (and a wink) in the early episodes of what is to come from Joan later on. The writing, production and cast are universally excellent once again, with particular mention to Nicole da Silva and Danielle Cormack who play Frankie and Bea. As in the first season, the use of slow motion image capture and end sequence music is particularly effective. I for one can't wait for season three."

      "content": "I put off watching this for a long time, under the false impression that it would just be a different version of 'Orange Is The New Black' (which I do love, but am not really searching for shows similar to it because I don't particularly like jail/prison shows) but man was I wrong. It is NOTHING like OITNB. Their similarities begin and end with it being set in a female prison.When I finally gave in and started watching, I was instantly hooked. Each episode is filled with action and drama and plenty of moments that make you either laugh or cry. The characters are unique and truly wonderfully played, you will quickly grow to love or hate each of them (sometimes both!) and as you learn their backstories you get a sense of really knowing and understanding them. There are some scenes that will literally have you on the edge of your seat, with your heart racing, yelling at the TV. After finishing this, I had to go find 'Prisoner Cell Block H' and give it a try. While it's nowhere near as good as 'Wentworth' (in my opinion) it was definitely neat to see the differences between the two. I'd definitely recommend Wentworth to anyone, I can't think of anyone I know who wouldn't like it, all of my friends who have watched it agree that it is one of their all time favorites! You will be kicking yourself for waiting so long to watch it!"

Not only is it interesting to see how Bea and Vera become the infamous characters we love, the acting and stories is just fantastic. While this is a prequel it also stands proud in it's own right as a fantastic and powerful Australian drama. I definitely can't wait for season 2 to come to the UK!!To the reviewer complaining that the characters are a \"complete contradiction to their original\"...I don't think you understand that this is NOT A REMAKE of the original but a PREQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL! The characters are completely different because they are possibly 20 years younger than they are in the original! If you loved Prisoner Cell Block H and you're interested in how and why the characters you loved became those people then this is ESSENTIAL viewing!"

I'm really upset hardly anyone I know doesn't watch it which is why i had to write this review as to why everyone should!

Story lines were just as crazy and you just never knew what was coming next. Vixens turned into saints, and good guys became bad guys. Nothing like a prison to reveal that it's hard to recognize who are really the heroes and who are villains.Technical quality and effects constantly improved over time as well.Whilst it will never be considered 'high art' it was an excellent look at the lives and times - as only the like of film makers and cartoonists can do."

I need more so starting at the beginning again!Much grittier than Orange (which I love) Wentworth has been a fave in our house since episode 1 minute 1.The acting, writing etc is stellar! Typical of my much loved Aussie dramas.It's so very different to it's predecessor Prisoner, yet still breaking the rules and stereotypes just like the original. Even the original song pops up now and then! So many much loved characters we'll miss!Couldn't ask for more in a show."

LOL I can't believe how quick some of theses woman's loyalties change, more than their under ware. Really interesting characters, back stories, and little cliques of women trying to act like families and have each others backs. Loved Bea, and was sad to see how she was transformed inside. If you haven't seen this show yet, what are you waiting for, Get to It! ;D."

      "content": "When I read the summary for Wentworth I thought it was going to be an Orange is the New Black knock-off, but I was wrong. Australian prison drama Wentworth is a ruthlessly dark. It's tragic and gripping, it has a lot of characteristics of OZ. Wentworth's careful plotting is a great example of what can happen when a show actually tries. It's smart and well acted. I actually prefer this show to OITNB. It has more depth and character, it just more real and gritty, like OZ. After each episode I just wanted more and more. It nice to watch a show that isn't over advertised or filled with famous names to rely on viewer ship. Superb acting from all of the cast."
