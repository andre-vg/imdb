      "question": "How many times has the series been released on DVD in America? Which version should I get?",
      "answer": "Dragon Ball (the original series, not Z or GT) has been released on DVD 3 times.1) The first release was the Kidmark release, which only covered the first 13 episodes of the series. However, this set was edited, and dub only. It featured the older voice actors who did not participate on later FUNimation dubs/projects/etc.2) FUNimation released \"saga set\" DVDs around 2003. These were totally uncut and even featured both dub and sub audio tracks. Unfortunately, they did not release the first 13 episodes due to licensing difficulties.3) FUNimation released \"season sets\" (five in all) in 2009-2010. This was the first \"complete series\" release in America, and featured the entire series in uncut form for the first time. These sets are what I recommend getting."
