      "answer": "At the end of season three series creator Dan Harmon was fired as show runner, effectively ending all his direct creative input into the show. On season four he was replaced by and Moses Port. What exactly happened and why is hard to say without diving into too much rumor and conjecture (the main rumour was his handling of the feud between himself and Chevy Chase). Sony Television released press announcements which were curt and lacked reasons for the firing. Harmon has been outspoken on the firing but his various responses run the gamut, sometimes seeming to blame himself and sometimes seeming to blame the network. Either way Harmon said on Twitter that he was not sure he was fired until heard the news with the rest of the world.Harmon had been re-hired on Community as showrunner for season 5. Notably after Chevy Chase exited the show. Edit"
