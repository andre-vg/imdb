It's hard for me to put into words how much I love this show. The only thing that's not good about it is the ending. The ending was pretty bad but that still doesn't take away from how good the show is overall. You should watch this show for Michael C. Hall's performance as Dexter alone. He's amazing in this. This is a thrilling, one of a kind tv show that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. If you haven't seen this incredible show yet just make sure you give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge watch it as fast as you can. Once you start watching you won't be able to stop!"

Hall) as he both solves murders and commits them too. He only murders bad people who've gotten away from the law. Being a blood expert he's able to outmaneuver the police at every turn. It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is just as fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show!"

Dexter is an interesting character, but, while making a sympathetic serial killer is an impressive feat, the show always kind of wobbled between dark and light, and I wasn't always rooting for him. The show kind of slipped in to a rhythm of finding a really messed up person who could bond with Dexter on a dark level, and then it all goes wrong, and Dexter has to kill the person. Actually, at least in the last couple of seasons, I was way more impressed by the Debra character, who suffers an almost Shakespearian tragic arc, which is almost inevitable given the show's premise. Debra was masterfully done, and I could almost palpably feel her pain.Season 1 - 8 Season 2 - 9 Season 3 - 8 Season 4 - 7 Season 5 - 7 Season 6 - 8 Season 7 - 8 Season 8 - 6."

The first four seasons were fantastic, and after that, it definitely slipped in quality. Some of the guest stars, particularly the villains, are great actors and fit into the cast seamlessly. Michael C. Hall is perfectly strange and feels at home in this role. His sister is a bit less of a classic actress, but her personality grew on me, and she's a crowd favorite. Overall, a memorable show."

      "title": "The Best Show on TV",
      "content": "After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z. Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. If you can stomach that, tune it for a mesmerizing look at what makes us human -- or inhuman."

Some episodes are brilliant and some, so so. After it became immediately popular, some of the stars that decided to join in on the dark fun, I loved, so be on the lookout for them. I won't spoil the surprises. This series is not for the faint of heart w. Explicit sex and serial killer actions."

      "content": "Been on my radar for more than a decade. Jus finished watching all the 96 episodes in 30 days on Amazon Prime. It ain't a record but the addiction with the character Dexter made it possible for me n the other factor is the lockdown.The character Dexter is a lovely manipulator wher he acts accordingly to the situation. A true psychopath.This series will make u ask q whether the character is truly living a double life of that of a serial killer n that of a family man working for the Miami homicide department as a forensic expert.Although some of the scenes r far fetched, the series is very intriguing n captivating n that is only cos of the character Dexter played very well by Michael C Hall.Many fans were upset at the finale episode but i think the conclusion is fair. The finale stayed with me for days. It is surrealistic n poignant. It may haunt fans of Dexter Morgan.The ethereal guitar music, the double life of Dexter, the dark humor, the camaraderie between the siblings n the talking of Dexter with his dead father is amazingly done.The dark humor is hilarious. Ther were times that during murder scenes i was laughing n my wife was kinda wtf.E.g. A serial killer known as Tooth Fairy labels Dexter a sick mother*ucker.Also when Dexter praises the same killer regarding his act near a cop's/attorney's house n the reply of the killer is hilarious.The showdown between Dexter and Ray (horned helmet aka the Minotaur killer) is full of tension. The way Ray chases his victims in his maze before either brutally beating them or maiming them with an axe is terrifying.The finale episode of the 4th season came as a shock. Cudnt believe my eyes. Thot mayb it is jus a dream.Check out Christina Cox as the villainous cop, one helluva hot babe."

If you like watching a show where we get the insights of how a killer works this is the show for you. Now here is the thing. This is my favorite show but shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones are better shows overall and I am not going to lie about that. The acting by the side characters are good but not great it does get better as the show goes on like any other show and it does have some dumb things like all crime shows have but having the main character be a killer is where the show is different then any other show. Dexter and Deb his sister are the best parts of the show she kills her role as wanting to become a better detective to prove to herself and others that she is as good as her father was. If i was going to really rate this show it is a 9 out of 10 but sense its my favorite show i have to give it a 10. Please give it watch if you wanna watch something that is different then other ones that you can watch right now."

Add \"The Excorcism Of Emily Rose\" star Jennifer Carpenter, who plays Dexter's sometimes moody sister, Deb.It's a hard accomplishment to get someone to actually love a serial killer. But Dexter is one of those few attempts that works. It's not forced upon you- the show doesn't shove the whole \"well this serial killer had a terrible childhood...\" in your face. And it doesn't need to in order to get you to love its main character. You just do.Michael C. Hall can play any emotion he's handed. Jennifer Carpenter fits her character perfectly, as does everyone else in the cast.Then there's the actual story lines. It's not clichÃ©. It's actually scary and chilling. It keeps you guessing. It's one of those mysteries that is very difficult to solve, but it still keeps your interest.'Dexter' can also be hilarious when it wants to be, depressing when it wants to be and especially thrilling when it wants to be. And it doesn't come across as trying too hard.Strong writing, clever dialogue, talented stars. It all makes for a wonderful TV show.

The show maintains the uncomfortable atmosphere of the novels with better fidelity than one could ever have expected, and Dexter (played by Hall) is all there.The visual elements from the show are stunning, to say the least. Disturbing, certainly, but more than that - fascinating. Watching the show, it's impossible to keep from finding a certain agreement in oneself for Dexter. He's a monster, and yet it's completely possible to identify with him.10 out of 10. This one has a permanent spot on my DVR."

      "content": "I love this show! Didn't think i would be going through it a 3rd time but since season 9 is coming soon i thought i would. So far im on season 4 and i have to say DAMN Jennifer Carpeneter character can be so annoying. The smallest thing can give her a brwakdown at any moment and that gets a bit annoying pretty fast. Rita is more annoying than Deb. Show is still my second favorite show ever coming after Game of Thrones. Which ive also watched 3 times."
