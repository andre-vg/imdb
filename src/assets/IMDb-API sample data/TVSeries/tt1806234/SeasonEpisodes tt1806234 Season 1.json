The only 7,000 years old Sahara, the planet's vastest sand-pan, counts many tribes. The stony Gobi enjoys melting snow, wind-transported in all the way from Siberia, but also counts roaming wolves. In the most arid Araucana, capturing the rare precipitation is an extremely refined art.",

Yet four million people live there thanks to ingenious survival techniques passed down through generations. In Greenland, where food is hard to come by and dogs are a crucial means of transport, Amos and his son Karl-Frederik embark on a remarkable journey across the frozen sea. They then fish for the giant Greenland shark by drilling a hole through the ice. This is food that will keep their precious dogs going for...",

Some still practice hunting-gathering, such as the Khoisan, or traditional 'natural' herd breeding, others as in Australia use technology to gain maximal control. Domesticating cereals and edible grazers was crucial in human history, leading to vast food surpluses and sedentary ...",
