Each episode of the series focuses on a different human-inhabited environment, including deserts, jungles, the Arctic, grasslands, rivers, mountains, oceans, and the urban landscape.\r\nFor the first time on a BBC landmark series, the production had a dedicated stills photographer, Timothy Allen, who documented the project photographically for the books and multimedia that accompany the series.\r\nBroadcast\r\nEpisodes\r\nOnly one creature has carved a life for itself in every habitat on Earth.

A first statement admitted that \"the portrayal of the tribe moving into the treehouse as a real home is not accurate.\" In fact, the tribe built the treehouse on commission for the programme. A second statement stated that a scene depicting \"a Lamaleran whale hunter named Benjamin Blikololong shown supposedly harpooning a whale\" is also inaccurate.\r\nThe BBC also later disclosed that a scene from the \"Deserts\" episode, which supposedly showed a wild wolf being shot at by Mongolian herders, actually showed a semi-domesticated wolf running to its handler, who was kept out of frame. The wolf was not shot at. Another scene depicting Venezuelan children hunting tarantulas, while implied to be taking place in the jungle, actually was shot in a television studio.\r\nAs a result, the BBC withdrew Human Planet from distribution pending a full editorial review.\r\nMerchandise\r\nThe Region 2 DVD and Blu-ray three-disc set was released on 21 February 2011.\r\nThe Region 1 DVD and Blu-ray three-disc set was released on 26 April 2011.\r\nThe Region 4 DVD and Blu-ray three-disc set was released on 5 May 2011.\r\nThe accompanying hardcover book was released on 20 January 2011: Templar, Dale (2011).
