      "question": "Why is the Mandalorian freezing people in carbonite when in Empire that was just a makeshift solution improvised by Vader?",
      "answer": "In The Empire Strikes Back the carbonite freezing process was a Bespin mining tool which Darth Vader and Boba Fett tested on Han Solo before trying to use it on Luke. Fett even expressed doubts about Han surviving the process, showing it was not, at the time, a standard bounty hunter technique.The Mandalorian takes place years after the original trilogy, so it's somewhat plausible that, after being used with success on a high-profile bounty like Solo (with the result being displayed by Jabba for months), the carbonite technique was eventually adopted by other bounty hunters with simplified, more portable equipment. It's also possible that the manufacturer of the Carbon Freezing equipment decided to capitalise on the freezing of Solo to manufacture the device used by the Mandalorian as a product for Bounty Hunters to use to transport their prey to their clients.It's also possible that the equipment on Bespin, normally used for freezing mined Tibanna gas, simply was not fine-tuned enough to cope with routinely freezing people. Vader's remark about it being crude but adequate supports this. Also, Lando's remark about Han being \"in perfect hibernation\" and Leia's reference (in ROTJ) to his hibernation sickness both suggest that carbon freezing of people is a 'thing'... enough that there's a term for the after-effects. That Vader would even think to freeze Luke, as per his original intention, suggests it's a known method for securing prisoners.In any case, the carbonite usage is also more efficient for the Mandalorian, who prefers to have multiple bounty pucks for the increased commissions - stacks of frozen prisoners are care-free and require little space Vs cells with active prisoners requiring food, meds, etc., needing additional space in an already small spacecraft."

      "question": "How can the bounty hunters track each one of their targets?",
      "answer": "They use \"tracking fobs\". The closer you get to a target, the faster the fob will beep. It isn't clear how the fobs locate the targets. It's likely tracking the DNA signature of the species of the target, also known as a \"chain code\"."

      "question": "When does this take place on the Star Wars timeline?",
      "answer": "The first season takes place five years after Return of the Jedi (9 ABY) and 25 years before The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. (Which takes place in 34 ABY)"

    {
      "question": "Is the Mandalorian related to Jango Fett?",
      "answer": "Not directly. Din Djarin (\"The Mandalorian\") and Jango Fett were both \"foundlings\". As in, children who were not born on Mandalore or one of its moons. But were adopted by Mandalorians and raised in a clan. Both are bounty hunters, but Jango Fett died in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which took place over 30 years before the events in The Mandalorian TV show. At the time of his death, Jango Fett had a clone son (Boba Fett), but it has not been established if he had any other surviving relatives."

    {
      "question": "How old is Boba Fett supposed to be?",
      "answer": "Boba Fett was cloned in 32 BBY. Making him 36 in Return of the Jedi. The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett take place roughly 5 years after Return of the Jedi which makes Boba 41. However, actor Temuera Morrison was around 60 when he reprised his role as Boba Fett. The aging could be explained by the acid burns he received while inside the Sarlaac. Even after several bacta healing sessions, some scars remain."

      "question": "How do the Mandalorians eat, shower, shave, etc. if they're not allowed to remove their helmets?",
      "answer": "Most Mandalorians do remove their helmets. There is only certain sects that follow the \"old ways\" and always keep their helmets on. The latter are allowed to remove their helmets to eat, bathe, sleep, and so on. But only if they are alone. They are not permitted to show their faces to anyone. Including in their tribe."

      "question": "Why doesn't the Mandalorian keep some sort of land vehicle in his ship since he needs one (sometimes at risk) so often throughout the series?",
      "answer": "It is plausible he prefers travelling by foot, as seen in many of the episodes. And Later using a speeder and Blurrg as vehicles to cover long distances, but only temporarily. It's likely that he can generally land close to his destination and he will hire a speeder if he needs to go farther. Also, the show is a homage to western and samurai films of the 50's and 60's which generally had the protagonist strolling in to town.He does gets awarded a Jetpack in the season finale, putting it to great use in both combat and covering distances with ease."

      "question": "Why doesn't anybody seem to know what the child is ? Surely Yoda was well known in the galaxy, and the child does seem to be remarkably like Yoda.",
      "answer": "The child (Grogu) is not Yoda, but merely another member of the same species. In the original trilogy Yoda is a recluse that only another recluse, and the top brass of the Empire, had heard of. It's not a leap at all to imagine the galaxy at large to have heard only legends or myths and those might differ. Also, while the name of the legendary Jedi Master Yoda may still mean something to people, it's possible his appearance was not widely known.Remember also that Yoda was 900 years old, and the only known of his species(besides Yaddle) to be found within the Replublic/Empire for all that time."

      "question": "Which characters and/or performers from the original trilogy appear on this show, if any?",
      "answer": "Luke Skywalker, R2D2, Boba Fett and Bib Fortuna are the most notable original trilogy characters to appear so far. Minor characters such as R5-D4 (the droid with the bad motivator) appears several times as well. EV-9D9, the droid that gives R2-D2 and C-3PO their jobs at Jabba's Palace appears as a bartender at Chalmun's Cantina."
