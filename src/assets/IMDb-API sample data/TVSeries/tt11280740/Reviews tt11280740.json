      "content": "Severance is a study of the philosophy and ethics of self. A dry lecture? Nothing could be further from the truth, this is a tightly-written, entertaining work of TV with these weighty concepts shown through story with little or no jarring exposition dumps.Visual cues such as the 'innie' 60's monotone dress code and the bland featureless white environment together with the monotonous meaningless work deny hope and support conformity. Garish reward events apply Pavlov conditioning, the punishments and close supervision create an environment of fear and uncertainty providing easy control.The gradual awakening of the 'inmates' and the ensuing disobedience, rebellion and subsequent violence is the core of this very human story. All this in a backdrop of consequential slow-reveal of an ever more complex situation and underlying uncertainty regarding the goals and motivation of the de facto prison guards.Addendum: Just watched the season one finale - it is simply superb, a fitting end to a fine series and creating massive potential for season 2. Just upgraded from 9* to 10* - very rare for me!"

The thriller aspect is glorious and I'm a couple episodes in. When the show first released it had a 7.2 and jumped to 8.2 that's well deserved!"

The viewer is then given enough interest and mystery to latch onto with a drip-feed of vital information in this beauty of a slow-burner. Overall it is an Orwellian-Kafkaesque mind teaser with a hint of Beckett's Godot dialogue. The perfect ingredient for a modern trippy journey into the unknown corporate dystopian..."

      "content": "The office workers for a mysterious and somewhat creepy company have all had their minds split into two, with their 'work' lives and 'home' lives having no knowledge of each other.-------------------------Just finished watching the first season of this, and it's been a real find. Nothing life-changing or even completely original, but a very, very good show, well-written, directed and acted the whole way through, with Tramell Tillman and Patricia Arquette coming out tops at stealing most scenes they're in, but Christopher Walken and John Torturro are splendid, too. Every character is intriguing and believable, and the revelations of the parts we get to see of their other lives all make sense and successfully propel the story along in ways that never feel manipulative or cheating.If I were to try describe the experience of watching it to someone I would probably say it's a bit of a knock-off of various Charlie Kaufmann films - particularly Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind - pitched somewhere in the vicinity of The Truman Show or Westworld, if Westworld was any good and still liked the human race.If there's any downsides, I would say it probably could have done a little more with the human ramifications of the process, showing us in greater detail what the severed characters were feeling and how the world appeared to them in this confused and diminished state. And I also think they could have told the story a little faster: I don't have great hopes that the quality will remain this high into further seasons, and I would have rather they made it a complete, standalone miniseries instead. Having said that, I'll be definitely be counting the months till it returns."

So I'm going to keep this very short for now and update with a full review at the end of the series.All I'll spoil, because I went into the plot blind before watching. Only going by the actors/director, stiller is still one of few unique film makers in hollyweird that can pull in great actors and decent budgets. This is series unlike anything airing and has great potential to be considered one of the greats of offbeat irreverent dark comedy series ever. Can't wait for the world building.Just give this one a chance, so far it's not political or effected by the real world. It's a universe unto itself. And I love it so far."

I was spell bound by his performance. It is unusually subtle and understated,but every facial expression, every word he utters is somehow spell binding.The other actors are all excellent as well, and this is always for me the crucial aspect of whether a show will be watchable or not.This show is unique and brilliant and really is essential viewing."

Fear not though, because Severance picks up with an increasing amount of drama and mystery, climaxing perfectly with a season finale that balances that fine line of leaving you wanted more, while quenching your appetite to remain satisfied until Season 2.Every metric you can measure and judge a TV show on is on display with absolute mastery. The casting, acting, script, direction, cinematography, lighting, set decoration.. everything is perfect.Actually I noticed a running theme for this review I've written is the word \"perfect\".

Well-cast, brilliantly-directed and edited, with one of the most spellbinding opening sequences in recent TV history, \"Severance\" is the perfect blend of Sci-fi, human interest, mystery, dystopia, and dark comedic undertones. \"Black Mirror\" is the only comparison that comes to mind but that show falls under the anthology category, therefore \"Severance\" is quite unlike any TV series you've ever seen before. As the mystery unfolds, you can't help but think about the layers upon layers of possibilities and various implications. While the early episodes may appear ho-hum, buzzing slowly, they are actually intricately developing each textured character if you pay close attention, positioning you for a satisfying payoff. Every actor stands out in their own right, from the trusty lead Adam Scott to veterans Patricia Arquette, John Torturo, Christopher Walken to Tramell Tillman as Milchick, my surprise favorite. This show is complex, and so for those who have not seen this yet and want to be entertained (Defiant Jazz!) and mentally stimulated at the same time, I recommend not waiting much longer to start S1E1!"

      "content": "My Review - Severance Streaming on Apple TV+ My Rating 9/10I usually don't review a series before the first season finishes but the first 5 episodes Severance has impressed me so much that if the quality of the final 4 instalment is as good as the first 5 perhaps my rating will be a TEN.Ben Stiller has directed 6 episodes of this critically acclaimed first series he said I read the screenplay to the pilot episode at least five years before the show premiered, calling it \"the longest thing I've ever worked on .\" His Production Company Red Hour Productions, was impressed and took up this futuristic story which doesn't look to far away set in a huge Corporate workplace that looks more like a minimalist factory. I would describe the series a little like the famous Fritz Lang's Classic Science Fiction movie of 1927 Metropolis meets George Orwell's \"1984\".The series looks great with minimalist sets or work stations with a very cold colour palette to help create the menacing environment . Filmed at the old Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey. The water tower out front was supposedly shaped like a transistor.In January 2017, Ben Stiller invited Adam Scott to star as Mark the promoted Team Leader of four employees at a sinister biotech corporation, Lumon Industries. Lumon uses a \"severance\" medical procedure to separate the non-work memories of some of their employees from their work memories .Mark, gradually uncovers the web of conspiracy from both sides of the division.Every character in this series I find interesting and the development of the story so far mesmerising it will eventually span 19 episodes so a long way to go.A few standout characters Mark of course a recently widowed nice guy who like all the employees of Lumon is very efficient because at work personal problems are forgotten as that part of their memory has been voluntarily severed.However when work finishes they have no memory recall of their work life.In fact no one working at Lumen really seems to know what they are working at because it's all coded but all are told it's vitally important.John Turturro as Irving and Christopher Walken as Burt develop an interesting and intimate work relationship working in different divisions they are not supposed to mix or form any sort of intimacy with other employees .Britt Lower as Helly a young new recruit tries to resign but no one seems to leave voluntarily at Lumon her workmate Dylan played by Zach Cherry is the joker of the work team and doesn't really get why his workmates are experiencing anxiety and just wants a quite life.The standout performance of this series for me so far is Patricia Arquette as Harmony Cobel for viewers of The Handmaid's Tale Harmony Cobel makes Aunt Lydia Clements look like Mary Poppins . Harmony is the most chilling character I've seen in a long while she is Big Brother,sorry Big Sister and spends her work days monitoring every workers performance and behaviour. Harmony is expressionless and unemotional assigning her henchman and spy Milchick to (Tramel Tillman ) to escort and administer disciplinary therapy to workers who step out of line.Patricia Arquette's character Harmony also spies on Mark in disguise a friendly old dear living next door I'm certain she's channeling the Evil Queen in Snow White . Mark of course so far has no idea who this seemingly sweet she really is as his work memory is severed from his personal life I can see an Emmy award in the future for her chilling role in Severance.I'll add to my review of course as series 1 of Severance concludes but I had to recommend it as this Apple TV Production I think is a stand out series ."

The whole mystery about this secretive company and the atmosphere inside the workplace is so well done. And what is the purpose of the employees job? What are they actually doing on those computers?The characters are perfectly cast in my opinion, and the acting was fantastic as well. I was so excited to see more from the characters private-self, and I did not see the twists coming that was revealed in the end of the season. For example, that Helly's innie was the complete opposite of her outie. Inside the workplace, she wants to kill herself, which she even tries to do, and her outie is actually a descendant of Kier and a high-level executive in the company. Just crazy and phenomenal. The last episode was so intense, can't wait for season 2!For now, this show is a 10/10 for me and I hope it stays that way after season 2. I have made 999 ratings on this site, and I'm glad that this show, a show that I give 10/10, will be my #1000."

      "content": "Severance is incredible, yes it's a slow burn from episode one but each episode keeps you enthralled with the excellent characters and tidbits of reveals thru to the season finale, never have I been so gripped to the edge of my seat with any show as I was with episode 9, literally shouting at the screen \"show him a photo\".Excellently written and superbly acted by the entire cast, bring on season two, as Irving exclaimed \"let's burn this place to the ground\".Can't wait!!"

      "content": "4 episode in and just wow, every character and every scene just screams 1984. In a good way, because thats one of the best novels to ever be.Its true, some of the scenes are uncomfortable to see, but we should see! Because this acting is a somewhat reflection to our lives and our jobs with capitalism dominating everything and destroying every meaning of live and make humans a semi robot who separates their lives from their work!The concept of the show is kinda freaky, will you as a fully-brained human, willingly sentence a part of yourself for slavery for 8 hours a day?. To you it doesn't feel a thing like a small nap and you still have 2/3 of the day to live. But for that part of you it seems infinite, always working! The literal definition of slavery!"

      "content": "Smashed the first two episodes and look forward to more. Looks amazing and feels claustrophobic, there is a real visual separation between the work and home self. Dialogue is witty and sharp, the fact that Ben Stiller directed this blows my mind. Great TV to kick off 2022."

      "content": "As for Season 1:Plot: after a very weird and quite stretched beginning (around three episodes or four, if I don't remember wrong), things will start being more and more clear and that's what everyone will have to wait before actually enjoy this show.By the way, the story itself is very good. Everyone who likes mystery/thriller should enjoy this.Actors & Actress and Acting: well, also this topic here is one that, the more you go through the show, the more you'll appreciate.Conclusion: do you like mystery/thriller? You'll have to watch this (not try, because the first episodes are the big obstacle you have to jump over before getting into the actual show, so try not to drop it).I have nothing else to say. Just watch it."

      "content": "I happened to get a free trial for Apple TV and decided to give it a go having heard nothing about it.I proceeded to smash the entire series in one hit and am now absolutely gutted I have to wait for the next instalment!This is a seminal tv programme that comes along once in a blue moon,something different,something that makes you think.On the surface it seems great ,a work you and a private you,but the more this series went on you realise that both versions have no real control over their lives and are living in hell.There are so many metaphors and thinking points I couldn't even begin to list them It is beautifully shot,the acting magnificent,the score absolutely haunting.There is so much to talk about with this series but no one I know has watched it yet!!!A truly brilliant series...just wow!"
