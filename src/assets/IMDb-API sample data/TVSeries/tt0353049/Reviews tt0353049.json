He also performs a stand-up routine as he shows you the clips and usually ends with a popular musical act. This is absolutely one of the funniest shows in the history of television! I've never laughed out loud so much at one show in my entire life! It's just a shame it only went two seasons because Dave lost his mind for a little while after Season 2 and didn't want to return for another season even though they offered him record amount of money at the time. This show debuted almost 20 years and it's just as funny today as it was then. Not many shows hold up after 20yrs but this is absolutely one of them. It's one of the best comedies of all-time!"

There's literally not one episode that's not hilarious. I've watched every episode several times over and laugh just as much every time. Like many others here have already said, it's an absolute travesty that it only went for three seasons. It's not because it was canceled because it was one of the most popular shows on at the time, it's just that Dave didn't want to do anymore for some reason. Chappelle is one of the funniest comedians of this era and this is peak Chappelle at his best!"

So we hunkered down for a Saturday, blazed some Laughing Buddha, and watched it all the way through. She said she understands why I am this way.Chapelle Show is genius, pure and simple.

Mostly all of the sketches are drop down funny. My favorite sketch is Prince but other hilarious ones are racial draft, rick james, wayne brady, the pee song, gay people like ku klux klan, boxer, lawnmower, etc. Other ones like when keeping it real goes wrong, \"We F*cked up\", and lots of other ones. I will buy both seasons of \"Chappelle's Show\" and I will hope there will be another season coming out because Dave Chappelle is an amazing comedian.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+"

But the reason I liked the show so much was because it was so brave and honest--particularly when it came to race. Chappelle's program was the only show on television that talked openly and honestly about race--something ALL folks need to do in this ultra-politically correct world. But even more importantly, these supposedly offensive skits were hilarious and worked. Plus, no one I know felt offended by them--particularly the wonderful skit about the blind black man who hated blacks because he didn't realize he was black! Another great one was his getting the seemingly white bread Wayne Brady on his show for an insanely funny skit! Brave...and insanely funny. Probably NOT a show for kids but wonderfully entertaining."

Yes it's a little too edgy and risqué for some people, but those aren't the people who I give a >bleep!< about anyway.It's not just Dave who does it all; he has a great cast around him (Ashy Larry may be one of my favorites), gets major names to drop in (Anthony Anderson, Mos Def, Wyclef Jean) and to stay (Charlie Murphy), and his longer-serving characters are no less valid than the fresh ones (Tyrone the crack addict).It is not for the uptight; it is not for the close-minded. What he pokes fun at is stereotypes, and that's a taboo for many people today. The barriers that political correctness attempted to break down over the last 15 years is exposed by Chappelle in 24 episodes, showing the truth behind the masks that we all wear. Those of us strong enough to handle it find him refreshing and downright hilarious. Those who don't will face the consequences as they manifest themselves in myriad other, humorless ways."

Dave Chappelle has starred in some countless funny movies. This show features some of the funniest episodes of comedy made so far. I think he should make another season but that is my opinion. All in all this show is one of the funniest shows i've seen. Also When the Chappelle Show first came on Comedy Central, I was amazed that they were able to air it. It made so many racist jokes that I thought for sure it wouldn't\\'t last 3 episodes."
