      "answer": "Yes. Dave's grandfather was born blind. He was born in 1911 in a white hospital to a white woman. His birth father is unknown. According to Dave on the DVD commentary, \"My grandfather looked like a white person. He probably was a white person...His dad was either black or white. Nobody knows. He could be white.\" He was adopted by a black family and he could not see himself so according to Dave \"as far as he knows he's a black dude that grew up in the streets of D.C.\" On the day of the assassination of Martin Luther King, some black people started riots. According to Dave, on that day his grandfather is on a bus and hears a group of black youths threatening a white man. His grandfather thought how silly the white man was to be in a black neighborhood while blacks were rioting. He did not realize that the white man was him. As his grandfather explained to the youths that he was black, one can imagine the confused looks on their faces."
