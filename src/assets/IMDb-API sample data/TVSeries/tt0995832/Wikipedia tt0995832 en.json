The miniseries was directed by Susanna White and Simon Cellan Jones and produced by Andrea Calderwood. The ensemble cast includes Alexander Skarsgård as Sergeant Brad 'Iceman' Colbert, James Ransone as Corporal Josh Ray Person, and Lee Tergesen as Wright.\r\nProduction\r\nThe cable channel HBO gave the go-ahead to a seven-part miniseries based on Evan Wright's book about his experiences as an embedded reporter with the U.S. Marine Corps' 1st Reconnaissance Battalion during the Iraq War's first phase. The series is set during the invasion of Iraq, from late March to early April 2003. The miniseries was shot over a six-month shoot from mid-to-late 2007 in South Africa, Mozambique, and Namibia. The miniseries was produced on a budget of $56 million, with an emphasis on the realism of the production design.\r\nCrew\r\nDavid Simon and Ed Burns co-wrote and executive produced the miniseries alongside Company Pictures' George Faber and Charles Pattinson, and HBO's Anne Thomopoulos. Andrea Calderwood was the producer; Nina Noble served as co-executive producer; author Evan Wright was credited as a consulting producer; Susanna White and Simon Cellan Jones directed the episodes; and two former U.S. Marines, Eric Kocher and Rudy Reyes, served as the production's military advisors as well as starred in the series.\r\nCast and characters\r\nThere are 28 starring cast members with a large supporting cast. The majority of the characters were drawn from the Second Platoon of the First Reconnaissance Battalion's Bravo Company. Lee Tergesen played embedded reporter Evan Wright, though throughout the series he is only referred to as \"reporter\" or \"Rolling Stone\". Wright was assigned to the lead vehicle of Bravo Company, which he shared with Staff Sergeant Brad \"Iceman\" Colbert, played by Alexander Skarsgård, Corporal Josh Ray Person, played by James Ransone and Lance Corporal Harold James Trombley, played by Billy Lush. To prepare for their roles as Recon Marines, the cast attended a six-day boot camp led by Eric Kocher and Rudy Reyes.\r\nOther starring characters, from 2nd platoon include:\r\nStark Sands as First lieutenant Nathaniel Fick\r\nMarc Menchaca as Gunnery sergeant Mike \"Gunny\" Wynn\r\nJon Huertas as Sergeant Antonio \"Poke\" Espera\r\nMike Figueroa as Sergeant Leandro \"Shady B\" Baptista\r\nJosh Barrett as Sergeant Larry Shawn \"Pappy\" Patrick\r\nSergeant Rodolfo \"Rudy\" Reyes as himself\r\nJonah Lotan as Hospital corpsman Second Class Robert Timothy \"Doc\" Bryan\r\nWilson Bethel as Corporal Evan \"Q-Tip\" Stafford\r\nPawel Szajda as Corporal Walt Hasser\r\nRey Valentin as Corporal Gabriel \"Gabe\" Garza\r\nSean Brosnan as Corporal Daniel Redman\r\nKellan Lutz as Corporal Jason Lilley\r\nRich McDonald as Corporal Anthony \"Manimal\" Jacks\r\nEric Ladin as Corporal James Chaffin\r\nDaniel Fox as Private First Class John Christeson\r\nAdditional characters;\r\nRobert John Burke as Major general James \"Chaos\" Mattis, commanding officer of 1st Marine Division\r\nChance Kelly as Lieutenant colonel Stephen \"Godfather\" Ferrando, commanding officer of the First Reconnaissance Battalion\r\nBenjamin Busch as Major Todd Eckloff, executive officer of the battalion\r\nMichael Kelly as Captain Bryan Patterson, commanding officer of Alpha Company\r\nBrian Patrick Wade as Captain Craig \"Encino Man\" Schwetje, commanding officer of Bravo Company\r\nEric Nenninger as Captain Dave \"Captain America\" McGraw, the erratic commanding officer of 3rd platoon, Bravo company\r\nNeal Jones as Sergeant major John Sixta, a loudmouth Battalion SNCO\r\nDavid Barrera as Gunnery sergeant Ray \"Casey Kasem\" Griego, Bravo Company's operations chief\r\nOwain Yeoman as Sergeant Eric Kocher, a long-suffering team leader under the command of \"Captain America\".

Salome Martinez Jr. as Corporal Jeffrey \"Dirty Earl\" Carazales\r\nNabil Elouahabi as \"Meesh\", the battalion translator\r\nEpisodes\r\nSoundtrack\r\nAlthough the series has no score, it features a large collection of music, much of it songs that were popular among the American populace in late 2002 and early 2003. The newer music (in the show's context) serves to illustrate pop culture during the time of the invasion. All of the songs are sung a cappella by cast members, with the exception of Johnny Cash's \"The Man Comes Around\" and Josh Ray Person's \"Re-Up Time\".\r\nEpisode 1: \"Get Some\"\r\nEpisode 2: \"The Cradle of Civilization\"\r\nEpisode 3: \"Screwby\"\r\nEpisode 4: \"Combat Jack\"\r\nEpisode 5: \"A Burning Dog\"\r\nEpisode 6: \"Stay Frosty\"\r\nEpisode 7: \"Bomb in the Garden\"\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nThe miniseries received very positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it received a score of 80 out of 100 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 86% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The critical consensus reads, \"Generation Kill plunges the viewer into war with a visceral force that's still somehow reined in by masterful storytelling and a strong command of period details.\"\r\nEntertainment Weekly gave the series an \"A−\" rating, and critic Ken Tucker remarked favorably on its avoidance of cliché, self-consciousness, and agenda-driven storytelling, and praised its execution, nuance, and verisimilitude. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote: \"the seven-part Generation Kill is what you'd hope for from the people behind The Wire: an honest, barely adorned, sometimes painfully vivid representation of life as we live it now. It's journalism converted to art, with both benefiting\". Austin Smith of the New York Post, however, was not as impressed; he described the series \"as dull and throbbing as a severe headache\".\r\nA red carpet screening of Generation Kill was held for U.S. Marines at Camp Pendleton in California, where the series was favorably received.\r\nAccolades",
