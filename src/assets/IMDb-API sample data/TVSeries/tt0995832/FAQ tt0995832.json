      "question": "Why did Patterson get in the fight with 'Encino Man' during the football game?",
      "answer": "Throughout the series, Capt. Craig 'Encino Man' Schwetje, proved himself to be extremely arrogant and incompetent. During any scene that included Patterson and Schwetje, Schwetje almost would always ask a stupid or irrelevant question or otherwise display his complete lack of comprehension. When this happens; Patterson, along with other officers usually exchange looks of \"I can't believe what an idiot this guy is.\".During the football game, Schwetje was acting as a quarterback (it's mentioned he was a star quarterback at home). So naturally he's actually good at football. Which leads to his team defeating the opposing team, which Patterson is on. As the game goes on, Schwetje continues to display very arrogant and obnoxious behaviour, mocking players on the other team, etc. Finally, Patterson punches Schwetje repeatedly for being such an arrogant moron."
