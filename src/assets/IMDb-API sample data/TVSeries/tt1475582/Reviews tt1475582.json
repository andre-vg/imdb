There have been so many shows and movies based off Sherlock Holmes but I can say with confidence that this is the best of them. The writing and acting is would makes this show so special. Every single season is just as good as the others. Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play this role...he is Sherlock Holmes. Martin Freeman also stars as Dr. John Watson and those two lead just an overall great cast. This show won so many awards including 9 Emmys over the course of its run. If you haven't seen this incredible series yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as possible!"

      "content": "To my surprise they absolutely nailed it. Cumberbatch is a fantastic choice for Sherlock Holmes-he is physically right (he fits the traditional reading of the character) and he is a damn good actor. Martin Freeman, about whom I wasn't sure at first, is an excellent foil for Holmes without being the dumb sidekick that Dr Watson has often been. I thought that this series would not work, particularly after Robert Downey's interesting take on Conan Doyle's characterisation. I have been proved so wrong-it moved along at a good pace and held the attention brilliantly. My wife started by saying she didn't like it but by the end of the episode she was as enthralled as I. We are both looking forward to the rest of the series, if it is as entertaining as the first story. I was disappointed to read some reviews here that did not love it. Methinks they are too jaded to enjoy anything."

It has a time set in the 21st century, which of course the story refers to a more modern case. Sherlock started its premiere season with three pretty good episodes. Featuring Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock and Martin Freeman as John Watson, they seemed to perform superbly and fit into their roles. Cumberbatch style capable of perfectly displaying and bringing the role of Sherlock to life. This series has a different story from the general Sherlock story. Featuring Sherlock who lives in modern times but does not forget the characteristics of the original story. This season has a unique and interesting story in its first three episodes. Able to display a good and simple but elegant mystery story. Have complicated conflicts in solving problems. It was the first season that directly introduced Moriarty as Sherlock's main enemy. However, in solving the case or the way Sherlcok reveals the truth, it is done with a quick dialogue so it is necessary to repeat what was said."

So far most of the original characters have appeared, with hints of more yet to appear. It is suspenseful and sometimes genuinely funny. I have read all the original stories, and after the late, great Jeremy Brett, despaired of ever seeing another top notch Holmes film. This is it, Brought up to date into the 21st century, but done with affection and respect to the original. Nice to see the writers have continued the theme of an intelligent (slightly bemused) Watson. CAN WE HAVE A FULL SERIES PLEASE. If not this is one I will return to again and again."

The show, created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, is based on the characters from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and follows the detective and his friend Dr. John Watson as they solve a series of complex and intriguing crimes in modern-day London.The series features outstanding performances, particularly from Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson, who deliver powerful and nuanced performances that keep the audience engaged. The writing is also exceptional, with well-crafted and complex storylines that build tension and keep the audience guessing. The series also features a strong sense of atmosphere and setting, adding to the show's unique tone and feel.The show also explores themes of friendship, trust, and the relationship between science and intuition.Overall, I highly recommend the Sherlock series for fans of crime dramas, and those looking for a series with complex and well-crafted storylines, superb acting, and a strong sense of atmosphere and setting. The show's exploration of themes of friendship, trust and the relationship between science and intuition adds a layer of depth to the story. It's a great series that keeps the audience guessing and on the edge of their seats."

      "title": "A Study in Picture Gallery Red",
      "content": "What we have here is a very interestingly rendered modern version of Holmes' first appearance, A Study in Scarlet, in which he meets Watson, they take the rooms in Baker Street and successfully investigate a series of murders. The story is rarely adapted for two reasons. The first is that the murders don't make sense without the dull, rambling back story which no one wants to dramatise. The Valley of Fear has hardly ever been dramatised for the same reason. The second is that this is Conan Doyle's first attempt and he introduced significant character changes to both Holmes and Watson in the short stories. Holmes, in A Study in Scarlet, is rather more deranged, more like Cumberbatch's Holmes than Brett's, much more an aggressive, painful thorn in the side of the police rather than the unseen assistant of later stories.So people who haven't read the book or have only seen Holmes on screen need to give this a bit of time. 21C technology aside, it's actually quite a faithful adaptation, even though they ditched the back story and gave the murderer another, more credible motive. Knowledge of the original isn't at all necessary, but it does change the viewpoint. While some were congratulating themselves on beating Holmes to the punch in spotting the profession of the murderer, readers of the original were being conned into believing that his next victim was going to be the American he was driving (the victims in the original are all American). In the original, the word 'Rache' appears at the crime scene, also in an empty house in Lauriston Gardens, written in blood. The police jump to the conclusion that the victim was trying to write the word 'Rachel'. Holmes knows that 'Rache' is German for revenge. Moffat turns it neatly and humorously around. In the original it's a red herring, in the new version, it's a vital clue. These riffs on the original abound and are almost always imaginative and amusing and often more than that. Mycroft as Sherlock's Big Brother, for example.Moffat and Gatiss treat the characters with all the loving respect that an author could wish for and serve up an adaptation which re-imagines everything that Conan Doyle put into his plots and yet delivers something very close to to their original purpose and effect. Holmes and Watson are products of their time, as they should be, but they are recognisably the descendants and inheritors of the originals. The baby is still gurgling happily in the bathwater.There's a lot more here than initially meets the eye and I have a sneaky feeling it'll get better.If it does, it's going to be very, very good indeed."

      "content": "I am not surprised that the earliest reviews are all ten stars, I would have also judged Series one and two with that score, sadly they took something away in the latter years, the show became too clever for its own good, they sacrificed style for substance. Back to the positives, the first two series, and in fairness The Abominable Bride I think are outstanding, they are clever, witty, absorbing, genuinely thrilling viewing. The performances throughout are sensational, I cannot compliment Cumberbatch and Freeman enough, they make a great double act, and inject a massive energy. I can appreciate the show as independent from the works of Conan Doyle, but when I want Sherlock Holmes, it's Jeremy Brett I look to. Personally, the highlight of the show was Andrew Scott, who's Moriarty was nothing short of astounding, he stole every scene he appeared in, a shame they killed him off when they did. I think Moffat took on too much with this and Doctor Who, and it seemed both shows dipped at the same time, he should have made a choice and focused on one show, it was surely too much work doing both. I hope very much that the show returns, and the genius that was evident in Series one and Two returns also. Highlight for me has to be The Reichenbach Fall, which is simply incredible."

I know its a modern take, but the core of the stories and its characters are the same. I have watched the Hollywood movies and while I love Robert downey, his portrayal was not true to the written Sherlock.Additionally, I didn't even realized the parallels that existed between the two time periods. Only when modern Watson came back from Afghanistan did I recall that novel Watson was indeed a veteran of a war in Afghanistan. The modern show aligned the story so well that I almost didn't notice a difference in time periods.The core of the novels is true in form in the show. Cumberbatch's version of Sherlock is dead on. I am so pleased by the production. It is my favorite and in my opinion, the most accurate portrayal of the Sherlock Holmes novels.Excellent. Excellent adaption. Highly recommended for lovers or the original novels."

Few minutes later, I found out that the 'difference' I experienced is what makes this series unique and brilliant. The cast is spot on. Couldn't have picked a better guy for Holmes or Lestrade. Yet, Dr. Watson doesn't match the original picture.Who cares hey? The story is full of twists and turns and fascinating to see the techniques of deduction. The merging of old reasoning and new technology has been done magnificently. So, its a Holmes with a laptop and a smart phone.that who we see.and that can be easily related than those 1800's detective.Hope this show will continue for many full seasons."

Sir Arthur would, I believe, approve of this adaptation and be pleased that yet another generation is able to live the thrill of the chase, the connection of obscure yet obvious (to a genius) clues... the little things that have a far greater relevance than you would normally perceive. For a first episode... BUGGER ME, I am more than hooked and now await more installments and hope that each episode is as brilliant as the last...

I cried at least 5 times just the first hour after I watched it. And countless times while watching it.I didn't eat for 26 hours just because I had to finish this show, and I don't regret it.The acting is probably the best acting I have ever seen. The cast is incredible.While I've only said positive things about this show, it doesn't mean it's completely flawless. The 2 first seasons are superior to the 2 last ones. Season 3&4 weren't bad by any means, but the 2 first ones are the best pieces of TV-material I've ever come by, while season 3&4 are just very good.This show deserves so much more fame than it has. Watch it. Now. You won't regret it.Overall rating: 9,7/10."

I don't know if this is the first of its kind, but I definitely find many resemblance to this series from many later TV series such as forever. It's basically the same idea with slightly different story background for main characters. Definitely worth watching. And it's definitely one of the first bromance TV series I have ever watched too. The relationship between Watson and Sherlock is so rare such that I keep looking for such relationship whenever I saw some TV series with at least two male main characters."

      "content": "I have been an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes from a very young age, and my first reaction upon hearing of a modern TV remake was \"oh bugger, they are so going to screw this up\". However, i am glad to report that, unlike so many other TV adaptations and especially ones that modernise, i found it witty, clever and above all, entertaining. It was extremely reverential of its considerable pedigree and included a large number of coded references and callbacks for the more avid fan, e.g. the use of scratches around a persons mobile phone charger port to indicate a drunkard rather than a pocket watches winding keyhole. I imagine many were irked by this and as i can see from the ratings many did not care for it at all, but for me it was simply sublime, and well deserving of a 10 out of 10"

      "content": "As a die-hard fan of the source material, I have tracked down and went through nearly every radio, television, film, and comic book interpretation of Sherlock Holmes - which run a mean gamut regarding quality, as you probably already know - and so I approached this incarnation skeptical but sanguine. Doubtful it would match the eminent Jeremy Brett series in quality, but hopeful it might preserve Conan's tone - something I think that series did well and the Downey Jr. movie did not.To my surprise, and delight, this show just so happens to be the bomb-diggity. Let me explain.Ever notice how lots of Agatha Christie fans complain when screenwriters change Poirot and Marple stories? I'm not one of them. I like new and different interpretations of those stories because otherwise, in the case of literary characters brought on screen, what's the point? What's the point if we film and re-film the same story, the same story which we've already read once, twice, maybe three times? Especially in many cases, what's the point when it's been done so perfectly before? In the case of Sherlock Holmes, The Hound of the Baskervilles has been filmed at least 24 times according to Wikipedia. So another iteration won't thrill me. However, one that takes liberties with the source material, i.e. bringing the characters into the 21st century, I'm all for it. Surprise me. That's what I say.And there are two things I really love about this series. 1) For longtime fans there are many, many \"Easter eggs\" to discover in each episode. And, best of all, 2) My boyfriend loves this series. And I can't pay him to watch a Jeremy Brett episode. He did enjoy the Downey Jr. movie (as did I, I just prefer a less swashbuckling Holmes - one reason among many that I didn't love the film), but he's never excited to watch Sherlock anything. This series is different. He loves it. For any Sherlock fan that would like to get their significant others on the band wagon, this is a great gateway. (And my boyfriend's actually a very good barometer for high-quality mainstream television shows. Usually, if something's firing on all cylinders, he knows it. More risky fare - he's off-put.)And, you may rightly ask, why should I give a crap what my boyfriend likes? Good question. I happen to be of the mind that TV and film can accomplish what my favorite art form - literature - cannot. The TV and film experience can be enjoyed by a group. Sure, book clubs discuss books, but with TV and film you and whomever you want to hang out with, experience story at the exact same time, in real time, and you can easily observe each other's initial, unguarded reactions. Plain and simple, it's fun to enjoy the mediums with others - to laugh together, to be scared, sad, thrilled, etc. It enhances the experience. I think literature's strength is the opposite. For me, the best thing about settling into a good book is that I'm alone. Just me and the test, together making up a story.Well, if anybody has read this far, I apologize for the rant. But if you're on the fence about buying the DVD or renting it or whatever, take a chance. Take a tip from me. You'll be pleasantly surprised. The more things change, the more they stay the same."
