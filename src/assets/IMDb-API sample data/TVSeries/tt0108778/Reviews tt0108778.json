Almost everyone can find someone on the show that they identify with. I've seen every episode numerous times (considering it's always on) and I still laugh just as much on every watch as I did the first time I watched it. I'll continue to watch reruns and laugh and I doubt that I'll ever get bored with this show."

I think you actually have to know the characters more for you to appreciate their humor. This show is one of my go-to's when I'm feeling so down. Friends is so overrated and is always in most people's recommendations that you just keep on scrolling past through the list but seriously it's a good show and worth giving a shot!"

The comedic timing and all the funny elements of the show is on point. And the most important fact is that after finishing the series we could just start the series all over again and feel fresh. It has an immense amount of repeat value that we wouldn't get bored even after watching several times. I could go on for pages but the memes, the sitcom references, the stars the show created all speak form them selves."

      "title": "The One that started it all!!!!!!!!",
      "content": "I started watching Friends this year and found it hilarious and amazingly written. The writing of the show is flawless. It truly is the funniest comedy I have ever seen. Each character is unique in its own way. The levity in the show is not what you would expect.Joey is the funniest character and his quirks and funny one liners never get old. He taught me to always have a humorous mind set in life and to not worry about what other people think if I do not understand something. Joey is in many ways the womanizer of the group and does not care too much what other people think and perceive of him. It is strange seeing him on the Joey show without Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica and Phoebe. He was a much better and funnier character on Friends. To be candid, I am not surprised that the Joey show got cancelled after two seasons.Ross is a character who got funnier over the course of the series. Introduced as a guy who got divorced by his lesbian wife, Ross built up quite a reputation. His relationship with Rachel had its ups and downs, but I always knew they were meant to be together. The writers and producers even teased their relationship in the series premiere. Ross's funniest line of the entire series is undoubtedly \"We were on a break\".Chandler is a character who changed and evolved the most. He was introduced as a guy who made sarcastic jokes about literally everything and never wanted to settle down with someone. He underwent a massive change in his life in the sixth season of the show. Season 6 was a major status quo shift for him.Rachel is a character who was introduced as this spoiled rich girl and slowly became successful and independent. She taught me that it is never too late to grow up and to never give up.Phoebe taught me to seize the day and savor every moment of life. Introduced as a person who never wanted to settle down with someone, that changed dramatically when she met Mike.Monica is a character who developed as a character and really found herself in season 5 when she started dating Chandler. I never expected Chandler and Monica to end up together. The phrase \"opposites attract\" is particularly true for them. Monica taught me to have an open mind and be bold.In a nutshell, Friends has something for everyone. It sheds a light on a variety of issues that are topical today. It is the funniest comedy I have ever seen. It is better than Two and a half men and The Big Bang Theory combined. Every episode is hilarious and makes you happy. For me, it does not decrease in quality nor are there terrible episodes. To be candid, no show can surpass Friends for its hilarity."

      "title": "One of the best t.v. shows ever!",
      "content": "Easily in my top five category of funniest and best shows in prime time history.Everyone on this show is so witty and delivers their lines superbly that it's hard not to like all of them equally. However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show. I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7. Who is that, you ask? Well, obviously Ross Gellar. Her roommate Monica's brother. Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine. Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more. But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy. But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: Now, I love Lisa Kudrow. She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show. She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:It's so funny to me that I like him so much. He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show. He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines. He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:They should have a shrine dedicated to this man. He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on! He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented. I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance. If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10. It's one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years, and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list.And that's my review."

A lot of people have complaints about the show saying it doesnt having enough POC characters and being unfunny? As POC i literally have no problem with the show's lack of POC characters honestly, i mean it doesnt bother me that much and i agree Seinfeld has better jokes than friends but it doesnt mean that friends isnt funny, its different and simple and flawed and that what makes the show so good to watch. A lot of people watch friends to learn english too so its fun. Not everything has to be \"woke\" and a masterpiece for people to enjoy and cherish and please do not forget the show came out in 90s and back then creators didnt focus that much about different agendas."

The humor is universal. I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced. Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing. Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!"

Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show."

Never could buy into shows that used laughter tracks (found it repulsive) but somehow the hype for this show always kept growing louder and louder around me, and after 5-6 failed attempts, I tried one more time... And VOILA! Season 1 took time to get into, but once past it, Seasons 2-6 were just freakingly amazing!! The best seasons of the show! By the end of S6, you develop deep attachments towards the cast and the remaining seasons, though not as great, still have a lot of good stuff. The acting in this show is truly exceptional and the comedy is priceless! And its also beautifully complimented with family drama to keep it well rounded! Will always be a fan favorite! I've finished possibly 4-5 reruns of this by now."

Friends is sure to make you laugh and want to get to know each character more. Its a television show.... there are bound to be goofs or inconsistencies, no television show has ever ever in the history of tv been 200% perfect. I plan on buying the whole series on Blue-Ray soon to add to my dvds."

      "content": "I love this show so much! F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a sitcom that you could easily binge-watch at any time of the day. I was able to finish the whole 10 seasons, which ran for 10 years, in under a month. That's just how great it is! I can't even give it a negative review about anything. You'll just really learn to love all the characters through time. No wonder people have clamored for a reunion with the cast, you just can't get enough of it.When you're feeling down and think you could use a good laugh, put this one on top of your to-watch list. It doesn't matter that the show ran from 1994-2004, the humor it had is timeless!In a perfect world where we could pick a series that could run forever, F.R.I.E.N.D.S would be that show. Notice how different TV networks are still doing re-runs at present time even after it has ended back in '04. You'll find that a new generation of viewers who are watching and loving it are surprised to discover that the cast are quite old already. Nothing could beat it."

      "title": "One of the better American sit-coms",
      "content": "I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond.First and foremost, I love the theme song. It may get on some people's nerves, but I find it irresistibly catchy, memorable and fun, with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant.I also love how funny and smart Friends is. Some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever. That reminds me when I see and review When Harry Met Sally, maybe the title of the review should be \"The One With the Scene in the Diner\". Along with this the writing is consistently funny, with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichÃ©d and cringe worthy. I even like the plot lines, I don't find them boring, predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile.The direction is also really solid, and the photography and scenery are striking.I love the characters, they are unique and engaging, even with their flaws they manage to be likable. Rachel does have moments when she is spoilt, but she is also the epitome of sweetness. I know there are people who have problems with Jennifer Aniston, the thing is I don't and I find her at her prettiest and most appealing here. Monica is another strong character, not the funniest by all means, but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude. I loved how Courtney Cox portrayed her. Phoebe is my favourite female character, she is hilarious; I especially love her songs, they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great. Lisa Kudrow couldn't have been the more perfect choice for her, she pulls off Phoebe's personality to perfection.Joey is stupid admittedly, but I love him anyway because he is also cool. I am not a huge fan of Matt LeBlanc, but he is really good as Joey. Matthew Perry is great as Chandler, who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character, who makes jokes that are almost as bad as Phoebe's songs, but he is still a likable character in his own right. Ross is deliciously neurotic, I constantly love his priceless facial expressions and David Schwimmer's delivery is absolutely perfect.There have also been some wonderful guest stars, Elliot Gould as Jack Geller, Gary Oldman(who I really like in films like Dracula and Immortal Beloved) as Richard Crosby, Michael McKean and Danny DeVito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policeman's outfit, all but to name a few. Overall, I love this show, not only for the writing but for the characters. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

      "content": "I try........not too hard, but I try.........to watch other sitcoms and actually try to \"hee-hee\" and understand the humor, but I can't! Will & Grace, and their annoying \"who's your daddy cr@p\", Two-Men-And Whatever-And-A-Pizza-Place, ohmigod... give me a friggin' break!It's not just that there is so much chemistry between the \"Friends\" cast that the TV could explode, though this is true. Actually, maybe that's the main reason it is as good as it is. What I mean: Although it is a show full of inside jokes that you understand a lot better if you've seen every episode before the one you're watching, it isn't *essential* to have seen any episodes before to start liking it and being hooked instantly. That's how it happened to me.I didn't start watching until season 4!! But once I did, I thought Rachel Green, Jen Aniston's char, was the coolest, and the cutest character. Now, it's more generic. I especially adore Joey and Chandler of course, and I also like the other three. Each character, except unfortunately for Monica, has grown positively in their own way.On a sidenote, I really do hope that the \"anchor\" quality Monica's character used to have can come back a bit in season 7. Especially as Chandler's fiance/ now, it would be a terrible thing to waste her character on just simple humor they exposed her character to in the last few seasons.Being a Friends fanatic, allthesame, I wouldn't want this awesome show (especially) to have even the *slightest* chance of wearing out its welcome. As it is, the cast agreed to sign for 2 more seasons(this one and an 8th), and I really hope it can keep up the quality it's always had in these to come. Although I adore Friends, I don't see any reason why they would want to tire a sitcom after these seasons are over. Especially since all 6 are extremely talented actors in their own right.-----***WATCH FRIENDS EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT, ONLY ON -- NBC -- !!!**----------Could I *be* any more emphatic? =)"

The characters are just great and the chemistry between them is just amazing; its so hard choosing who my favourite character is because they are all amazing!!! What i also like about this sitcom that it isn't always sexualized, most of the episodes are pretty much PG which makes it watchable for younger audiences or people who are not comfortable with watching sexual activities or references on a sitcom."
