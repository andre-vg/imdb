      "title": "Finally: The Boat We Were Meant To See",
      "content": "When a film about World War II has American audiences routing for the Germans, hoping and cheering them on for the success of their mission, one can only become conscious of the ultimate horror and futility of war. One also has watched a helluva movie. Back in the early 80's I called in sick (along with some friends) to see the opening of Petersen's Das Boot. We were all stunned. Went out for a beer and then returned to the theatre and watched it all over again. Petersen masterfully developed his cast into a crew who are no longer \"the enemy\" but fresh faced kids, neither prepared nor aware of the horror that was waiting them. When I first saw \"Das Boot\"  I was the same age as those kids so it resonated more powerfully than I could have possibly imagined. In this wonderful uncut release of the original German miniseries we're forced to spend even more time with the crew of U-96 and in that time get to knew them better. We see friendships and bonds formed, the irritability that comes with lack of privacy and tension so dense it becomes an almost physical presence. We also get more of the sense of what war really is  immense spans of boredom and ennui interrupted by the occasional horrors of violence and death. Petersen kept his cast indoors and unshaven during the entire shoot with the resulting effect that the crew actually looks like a group of men who have not seen natural light, or breathed fresh air for 65 days. Additionally, the actors were all put through vigorous physical training so that when racing through the set of a dangerously reconstructed U-Boat, they move naturally with an almost balletic swiftness that is dazzling. This is masterful film-making of the highest order, with sound and lighting that capture the claustrophobic nature of a submarine, almost suffocating the viewer. The scenes of Das Boot racing through the Atlantic, it's difficult near fatal destruction in the narrow Strait of Gibraltar will have your blood pumping at fever pitch.The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent, each actor - even ones with little to no dialogue, making bold indelible choices in developing their characters. Jürgen Prochnow as the Captain gives a remarkable, strong performance, making one believe - from the very beginning - this is a true leader of men.You have no difficulty believing this crew standing behind this captain's every decision. Petersen's writing of Herbert Grönemeyer as the eager young reporter, Werner is a masterful creation. Werner becomes the multi-faceted prism through whom we watch and live this story. Part Greek chorus, part conscience of the uninvolved, we join him as an outsider on the inside, becoming participants in this heart rending drama. Grönemeyer's performance becomes the very soul of Das Boot.\"Das Boot\" remains one of my all time favorite films and to finally be able to own and see it as Wolfgang Petersen intended is one of the best things to happen since the invention of DVD."

      "title": "The ultimate war film",
      "content": "If you want an action movie, watch something else. Das Boot reflects what war must really be like, showing not just the 1% of terror and confusion, but also the 99% sitting around waiting for things to happen. It is also the best if not only explanation I know, of how honourable men could have fought for the Nazis. I have now seen \"Das Boot\" 4 times. The first time was the \"Director's Cut\" with subtitles. Since then I have learnt German, so each time I watch the film I understand it better. It is still very difficult to follow, and a great deal passes me by; I think this film probably has the hardest German of any of the 50 or so German-language films I've seen. This is part of its authenticity; you don't expect people to speak Standard High German when they think they may die horribly in the next five minutes. The original mini-series has about the same amount of action as the Director's Cut, but a great deal more explanation and character development. For example, the Captain gets to comment on his actions towards the English sailors from the sinking oil-tanker. I think the sound of the Director's Cut was redone for Dolby-7, so the noises seem to come from all around and at times make you want to hide under the seat. However in all other respects, I think the mini-series is very much better than the Director's Cut, brilliant though that is."

      "title": "dirty, long, wildly shot and captivating to take in - and that ending!",
      "content": "For lack of a better comparison, Das Boot basically did for the war film - and that small sub-genre of WW2 submarine pictures - what Alien did for science fiction space movies: it looks and feels dirty in this environment, and the people who work on these vessels are hard-bitten and look filthy and are more like blue-collar workers than what one would normally picture them being in. In Das Boot (or, of course, 'The Boat'), Wolfgang Peterson adapts Bucheim's journalistic WW2 story about a U-boat in late 1941 who are tasked to go into the North Atlantic and take on the enemy, primarily British convoys and other boats of the like. It's a grim, relentless, sometimes depressing but often invigorating story.One might also be thwarted, as I was for some years, about the idea of 'Huh, the Germans as the heroes of this story, get outta here.' But it's more complex than that, or rather it's not as simple as 'They're Nazis' in that way. Actually most of these officers and naval-men on this U-Boat, run by Jurgen Prochnow's character, have no real firm affiliation, and when they meet other officers when they pull for a brief stop in Spain, they don't even 'Sieg Heil' the other officers. Why this works for an international audience, why it didn't just stay a German-based sort of entity with minimal interest for outsiders who might still have grudges, is that Peterson and company a) don't have any real interest in the politics of anything, it's ALL about the sub and what the missions are, and b) the depth given to the characters (certainly in the director's cut, if not the even longer version) makes these people stand out as people first and foremost.Are they all super complex? Maybe not. Some come close to being clichés and stereotypes, though other times, wisely, before s*** hits the fan, there are some scenes given to showing the men just talking like men, about sex stuff, goofing on each other in that Tough sort of manner. Probably my favorite supporting character, aside from the Correspondent Lt. Werner, the sort of audience surrogate (rather, the guy who other people can explain stuff to so we know), is Johann. He has not a ton of scenes, but he has enough to have a clear, interesting arc where he works in the engine room, and during the big centerpiece of the film where the U-Boat is under attack from the Convoy and they're losing ground, he abandons his post and loses his mind for a few minutes. He apologizes, but can he really redeem himself? Certainly among this cast he has one of the most expressive faces and eyes.This was a fascinating watch for me in a number of ways - the fact that the filmmakers were able to hold attention for long stretches where, frankly, not a lot is \"happening\" action-wise, and we're made to just sit with these people and see what happens when they don't have enemies to attach or problems to solve, was one thing. And Pruchnow is a good actor who, frankly, is most effective in scenes involving eye contact (he has good, steely-blue type of leading man eyes), and when there's danger and he has to raise his voice. Otherwise, he has to be the Rock for these men, and does a good job. Other performances range from very good to just decent, but no one is bad at all here. Also, I should note, this uncut \"miniseries\" version (which, on DVD, is presented as a regular movie, albeit 4 hours and 53 minutes long), sheds light on some things that otherwise were left little spoken or mentioned, more moments of depth and character development. As Ebert noted in his review, one such thing you can see is the difference in this and the director's cut in how the bombing of the British ship is dealt with (the ones not saved by the Captain) - here it's clearer and, frankly, a bit more fulfilling dramatically speaking.Yet what made this go from being a very good experience to a great one, was the finale. I wouldn't dare reveal what happens even with a 'Spoiler' warning, but suffice to say it's one of those moments where I practically had to laugh in astonishment. For a film this unrelentingly harrowing and bleak, the ending throws the kind of \"twist\" that is far from something unbelievable or out of this world. On the contrary, it's so logical and spot-on as a dramatic moment that it made everything else coming before it matter more - or at least have an ironic light to it. Das Boot is one of those very long \"guy\" movies that goes past how we usually view war films; the action happens and is any-number-of-ways-to-say-intense, but the time spent with the characters, observing them, seeing how long they're in this environment before things start to happen, gives the experience the texture of a long novel."

      "title": "Epic Naval Drama",
      "content": "Das Boot is considered by many one of the best war films ever made. They have been a number of versions, the theatrical cut and the director's cut. The film was financed by German television and the director Wolfgang Petersen converted it into a 6 hour mini-series. The DVD is an epic 4 hour 42 minutes, cut in a seamless fashion.Das Boot is a rare film, a film that tells a story of World War II from the German perspective. It shows the mission of U-96 in the winter of 1941 when the Battle of the Atlantic is turning towards Britain's favour. Britain is using the convoy system, having more supplies from the American merchant navy and the Britain navy is getting better armed, so starving the nation seems hopeless. The crew are on a simple mission of trying to sink as many British ships as possible whilst avoiding British patrol planes and destroyers, a very tough think to do. The focus of Das Boot is on the experienced war weary captain (Jürgen Prochnow) and Lieutenant Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer), a young war corespondent for the German military and an outside to their world. All the characters are individuals, treated with respected, even the only character who is a Nazi is treated like a human being. This is a complex drama about the moral of warfare and the collective spirit of serving in a submarine. It is a tough world where young men are serving in one of the most dangerous fields of war during World War II. This a conflict where they are long moments of boredom in a close environment. This can lead to conflict within the crew. Whilst when the U-Boat does find a convoy it can be a massive struggle between life and death for the whole crew.Das Boot is clearly Wolfgang Petersen best work. He shows the claustrophobic environment of what a U-Boat would have been like. It is a noisy environment, and it can lead to conflict within the crew, but also the crew are also close and have to be because they depend on each other. As well as the moments of boredom to show character development and debate the war, Petersen also knew when to add the tension and made Das Boot an instance experience. He also showed his skill with action. Wolfgang Petersen focused on character development, unlike his Hollywood films. He does not villainize either the British or German navies, or the people who fought in the war. Despite Das Boot is based on a fictional novel, it is one of the most accurate portrayal of naval warfare during World War II.Das Boot has a very 80s score to it, using modern instruments, which surprisingly works, adding to the imagines. I personally would have gone for a more classical score, but that's just me.A must see."

It is not only the story which makes this one great but also the acting, the lack of special effects and the authenticity. And of course Jürgen Prochnow is king!"

Fortunate enough, this film lack the big special effects,which makes it stand excellent against time.I prefer the mini over the feature movie. The slower pace and the closeness to the characters really gets to me. Over the years I must have seen this film more than 50 times,and it's still great! The casting is excellent and so is the directing. Wolfgang Petersen have done really well with a great novel. He captures the boredom and the fear in war in a superb way.Perhaps the labeling of this film as a \"war movie\", has scared off many viewers from a great piece of art. Both those who dislike war movies and those who like war action."

      "title": "TV miniseries recommended over the movie version!",
      "content": "Despite the extra length, I would *strongly* recommend the mini-series version. I first watched this when it came out on TV as a mini-series (293 min, 1985), then recently as the movie version (149 min, 1981), and then the mini-series again.In cutting the length down for the movie version, what largely remains are action scenes. Retained in the mini-series version are the quieter more reflective, atmospheric scenes, which in my opinion are what most make Das Boot truly AWESOME. These scenes gradually and subtly develop the characterizations of the crew members: their divergent political beliefs, the tensions among them, their cynicism or honor, their bravery or fragility. The submarine itself is a central character too: emerging through the depths like a great lethal whale, or plowing through the spray in rough weather, or floating calmly across the placid ocean surface, all to the backdrop of the haunting and memorable theme music. These subtle atmospheric aspects are what most stayed with me for 30 years. I would also suggest watching it in German with subtitles - one of the things that makes this an unusual WWII movie is that it is from the German perspective, and hearing it in German gives a more intense feel for that Germanic aspect and its special qualities (even if you don't understand German). Das Boot is an amazing experience, and it is well worth immersing yourself in the original full length miniseries version for a memorable and unique experience."

      "title": "Thinly Disguised Memoir Which Gives Even Greater Credability",
      "content": "I researched German U-Boats for many years, interviewed surviving crew as well as current day German naval officers. I read at least 100 books on U-Boats. I did this to research my novel, An Honorable German, a World War Two naval epic told from the point of view of a heroic yet deeply conflicted German naval officer, published in 2009. I say this to establish my credibility to write the following review.Das Boot is based on the novel of the same name which is a thinly disguised memoir by the author, Lothar Gunther Buchheim. This imparts an authenticity to the film often lacking in many war films. The author of the novel was actually aboard the U-Boat on several war patrols. The IMDb lists the German actor Jürgen Prochnow as playing Capt.-Lt. Henrich Lehmann- Willenbrock, the actual commander of U- 96 and 6th highest scoring U-Boat ace of the war when Buchheim was aboard and not the fictitious commander of the U-boat always referred to as the \"Old Man.\"I would strongly recommend that you watch the movie in the original German with English subtitles rather than the version dubbed into English. You get a far better feel for life aboard a German U-Boat when the men are speaking in German and you hear the urgency in the voices of the actors as it would have been in real life. Buchheim was a war correspondent working for the German Propaganda Ministry (all war correspondents in the Third Reich worked for the Propaganda Ministry) and in that capacity he went on two war patrols aboard the actual German U-Boat, U-96.I can say with every assurance that this film is an accurate description of daily life aboard a German U-Boat in World War Two we will ever see. But even more important, this film depicts the horror and terror of war in the most compelling way possible. To me, no other war film comes as close to Das Boot in depicting both the boredom and terror of war.The film is extremely accurate in its depiction of the foulness of everyday life aboard a German U-Boat. None of the boats had bathing facilities so the men could never clean themselves except with a bucket of salt water from the ocean. Nor could they wash their uniforms, of which they were only allowed two while on board.They had special salt water soap but all that did was irritate the skin. Boils, rashes and skin infections of all kinds were common among U- Boat crews. Fresh water was strictly rationed and none could be spared for bathing. The men did receive a cup of water each day for brushing their teeth and cleaning their face etc but most were so thirsty from strict water rationing that they just drank the cup of water.Food grew slimy and green with mold as shown in the movie and there was such limited storage space that sausages really did hang down in the compartments as shown in the film. Fresh food only lasted a few days and the rest of their food came from cans.Because of the rocking of the boat and monotonous diet, the men developed constipation. Unlike American submarines in World War Two, German submarines had no air conditioning or heat (except for so small portable heaters). The boat took on the temperature of the water outside the hull so you can imagine how uncomfortable this must have been. Ventilating the boat was very difficult and many crewmen developed lung problems.When the movie first appeared in Germany in 1981, it was vilified by many surviving U-boat crewmen. Small details were pounced on and men said \"we didn't have that on my U-Boat\" which is sort of meaningless since no U-Boats were equipped exactly the same. What is more interesting about the vilification of the movie, which gave it immense publicity in Germany, is that the former commander of U-96, Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, was on the set everyday advising the actors and the director. The \"old man\" had survived the war and in what must have been a surrealistic experience, he later helped put the movie together and coached Jürgen Prochnow how to play Lehmann-Willenbrock, that is, himself.Another high scoring U-boat ace, Erich Topp, advised on the movie as well. Those who criticize the film usually fail to point this out. This was one of the first movies to use the technique of hand-held cameras to give the viewer a sense of the movement of the boat and the men. This technique had become ubiquitous today and in my opinion overdone.This film is an incredible work of art and is, in my opinion, the greatest war film ever made. There is no \"sugar coating\". The brutality and randomness of war are shown without any attempt to make them \"pretty.\" If you are only going to watch one war movie in your life, then watch this one."

Obviously as I grew older and wiser, and having several German friends through work, this perception changed. That said, if I ever watched a 'War Film', I still rooted for the 'good guys', i.e. us.This great movie changed all of that, the claustrophobic atmosphere draws you in and you start to feel as though you really know these men. The boredom, the sense of isolation, the closeness of being squeezed together in such a confined space. The terror of battle, the stress of the U-Boat being relentlessly crushed every time it dives.I remember feeling the horror when the U-Boat backed away from the burning survivors of the ship they had torpedoed. But the humanity expressed when the young officer broke down in tears on the bridge and the look on the captains face when he realised they had not been rescued after finishing the ship off. Knowing he would never have fired on it with men still on board made me see it in a different light.The individual heroism was no different to those men on our 'side'. I inwardly cheered when the U-Boat rose to the surface and the engines started in the Straits of Gibralter.I found myself seeing this in a different light, I found myself glad I had German friends 'before' watching this great movie. I knew I had watched something so profound, the ultimate anti-war movie.I am just so grateful to have been able to see this, and I have often wondered what the reaction might have been if this had been shown in 1950.All in all, it's a must see movie that will continue to change perceptions."

      "content": "1941 and the Battle of the Atlantic - German U-boats versus freighters supplying Britain - is underway. We see this struggle from the side of a German U-boat crew, U-96. We see them relaxing and having fun in port, the boredom of patrol, the tension of stalking a convoy and the sheer terror when they become the hunted.This is the 5-hour mini-series version of the 2.5-hour movie released in 1981. It's essentially the original film with many of the edited-out scenes added back in. In 1997 director Wolfgang Petersen released a 209-minute Director's Cut of the movie.The 1981 movie is a brilliant military drama. Probably the most accurate depiction of wartime submarine life you'll ever see and surely one of the most realistic war dramas ever made. Incredibly tense at times and extremely enthralling.Superb plot, great action scenes, especially for its time, and solid performances. The film is also quite novel for its time in that it is a WW2 story told from the German perspective.Incredibly difficult to find any fault with the film: a masterpiece in every respect.With all this in mind I was a bit sceptical as to how the mini-series would compare. The film seemed so perfect: surely adding in scenes would only diminish its quality. Turns out, no, it doesn't. In fact, it seems to make it better.It's been a while since I watched the movie so I can't say exactly, on a scene-by-scene basis, what has been added to turn it into a mini-series. However, it seems that, while the plot and action scenes are largely untouched, in the mini-series we get to spend more time meeting the crew, seeing their daily routines, seeing the relationships and niggles between them and seeing the effect of combat on them. This increases the engagement factor substantially (not that the movie isn't engaging already - far from it).The 5-hour running time does even matter: it just speeds by, such is the level of engagement and enthrallment. I watched all 5 hours in one go and couldn't tear myself away.Overall I'd rate the mini-series even better than the movie (and I didn't think that was possible)."

Right up there with Band of Brothers, Generation Kill, Long Road Home but consider its from 1981 I would rate it much higher. No CGI, all just pure hard handy work in the Bavaria Film Studios!"

      "content": "seems like everything is right about this movie/series. the actors are all really good & the camera-work is excellent. great use of colors also... you know it's war, but still you have all the sympathy in the world for the crew. it's like a world of its own inside \"das boot\". you can't help but feeling claustrophobic when you watch it, especially when the boat dives deeper & deeper to shake of the enemy...then the attack from above starts & you really start holding your breath, it sucks you in, in ways only movies of very high quality can. i watched the long version, but it felt like it was not that long at all, because it was such a thriller. amazing film, a classic."

      "title": "Intense realism",
      "content": "Review of the Complete Miniseries: DAS BOOT is a film which prides itself on its intense realism as it explores the trials and tribulations of a German submarine crew in the Atlantic during the Second World War. The lengthy running time of this miniseries allows us to really get to know a group of tough but human characters, presided over by the excellent Jurgen Prochnow as the captain who struggles to hold it all together.This is a slow production for at least half of the running time as it strives to put across the boredom suffered by men who are trapped in an underwater sardine can for weeks on end. Despite the lethargic pacing, it's never dull; Wolfgang Petersen's direction is gripping, even in the quiet moments. And when the action hits, as it does, it's all the more impressive and terrifying because of the long build up.DAS BOOT is a claustrophobic and often terrifying thriller that really puts across what its like to serve in a submarine. The underwater action is familiar from other productions - there are only so many things that can happen to a submarine in wartime, after all - but it's all done so professionally and, well, properly, that it remains fascinating to watch. The scene with the men on the burning boat is my favourite, but the powerhouse climax is equally moving. It's a must-see WW2 adventure and I'd recommend watching the longer 'director's cut' instead of the movie version. I feel inclined to check out the even longer 'uncut version' at some point..."

      "content": "It had been a while since I last saw the movie version of \"Das Boot\", but I had never seen the full \"picture\" (no pun intended, especially since this version is a TV show/series). Watching this, I do think that some may feel this is too long, but most people will see this for what it is: a great journey! And so many themes, that almost everyone should be satisfied.We get a group of people during the second world war, having to go through and under a lot of pressure (ok pun intended this time). The acting feels as reasl as it gets and the setting (sets) play a big role in this. Even actors who may have not become anything really are on their best here. One could say that the best is squeezed out of them (again no pun intended).The backdrop of the war, the fact we are largely in a tight space with our main group and then some people, might take a toll, but it also creates a unique atmosphere. This is not easy and some things wll stress you out, but that is what this is about."

      "title": "Greatest TV series ever?",
      "content": "Is 'Das Boot' the greatest ever TV series? It certainly ranks alongside 'Washington - Behind Closed Doors' 'Talking To A Stranger' and 'Edge of Darkness.' But it was made and released as a movie first, but they still managed to get 300 minutes' worth of film out of an original movie cut of 140 and a director's cut of 209?!!! The TV series works because it plays out the length of time, the boredom of wandering the Atlantic looking for prey, and the claustrophobic life of being on a Uboat at rest and under attack. The characters grow or stay the same as nerves and personality gnaw away under tremendous stress and pressure. A magnificent achievement, especially for 1981. It packs a punch, if not quite the same effect as watching 'Salvador' or 'All Quiet on the Western Front' the first time, as it tells the story of a predatory, merciless weapon of pretty vast destruction preying on defenceless merchant ships, whilst at the same time being hunted by an enemy that is technologically and logistically gaining the upper hand. Superbly acted, directed, and staged, this film/TV series stands with the all-time greats - watch and be stunned!"

Wolfgang Petersen will forever be remembered for it.The stellar acting, chemistry and camaraderie between the cast, ultra-realistic situations, especially in the sub, quality in production and superb visual effects for the early 80s make it a classic gem.Of course, the situations depicted are not insanely logic, but that's not the point of the series, which is showing the amazing relationship and connection between the Boot's crew and in that it succeeds tremendously.A classy production worth appreciating every minute of it, spearheaded by the amazing Jürgen Prochnow."

The close-up of his eyes put chills down my spine.You can watch this movie numerous times and always find something you missed."

      "content": "The verisimilitude is (presumably) immaculate; I have never been aboard a U-boat, and after watching \"Das Boot,\" I am quite thankful that I was not a young German in the Kriegsmarine during World War II! Seriously, though, \"Das Boot\" is movie-making at its finest. Watch it. Watch the Uncut Version. (It is not much more explicit, just longer, bringing some sequences to near-real-time.) Spend half your day watching the movie, and the other half contemplating the depth of what you have just seen.Every aspect of this production is genuinely superb: from Klaus Doldinger's leitmotif that has variations ranging from doleful dirges to rousing fanfares, always with the same music; to Juergen Prochnow's restrained and dark, but ultimately cynical and reasonable acting; to the claustrophobic camera angles filmed in a period-accurate \"iron casket\" with no removable walls. The diegetic (occurring in the story) music is memorable and well-chosen, including the out-of-control jazz music in the La Rochelle nightclub, the \"Tipperary song,\" and the Captain's personal favorite song.With movies such as this one, \"Downfall,\" and \"Das Leben der Anderen,\" German cinema has shown a level of admirable candidacy and skilled artistry in depicting the modern country's distant but troubled origins.Even if you don't like war movies or submarine movies, even if you don't speak a word of German, WATCH \"DAS BOOT,\" because it is legitimately powerful, genuine, and impressive. 10/10."

I have never seen the shorter version, but I would highly recommend this version as you need the time to experience and indulge every single detail in order to fully experience the panic in which the crew is going through. And I believe that's only achieved in this longer version. It's well worth the watch. You won't be disappointed!"
