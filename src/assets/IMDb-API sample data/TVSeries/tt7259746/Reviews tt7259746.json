      "content": "The small handful of negative reviews I've read seem to take issue with Jonathan's flamboyancy, but a lot of these critics are self-proclaimed gay men who have a problem with \"negative gay stereotypes.\" I'm here to tell you there is nothing innately negative about flamboyancy other than the fact that our society deemed all things associated with femininity as inferior. In other words, those reviewers are projecting their own self-hate and internalized homophobia onto this show, and their reviews reflects their own baggage, NOT the quality of the show. So what if Jonathan is a bit extra? If you can't learn to find him endearing, admire his unapologetic courage, or appreciate how he really rounds out the spectrum of masculinity displayed on the cast, you won't see how much of an essential part he is to the show's theme of acceptance in the diversity of people.That aside, the design transformations are aesthetically on point, incredibly tasteful and thoughtfully custom-tailored to the hero subjects. And, the best part is, the show has a lot of heart. It is uplifting and motivating--it transcends outer beauty as it promotes self-care, self-respect, self-confidence and self-worth, but also love and acceptance in a toxic culture. It's a feel-good without the escapism which makes for a cathartic viewing experience."

The Fab Five have experienced addiction, homelessness and horrible pressures from their families. The show gives me so much hope that there are actually human beings who can be kind and care for others in a sincere way.I thought I would hate the show, but I always feel lighter after watching it.

Of course there are some unnatural scenes, like extrapolation or disconfort in front of the cameras, and whatever, but The Fab Five are not professional actors, they are themselves doing and living what they believe, and the guys chosen are real people, working their dreams and fears in between the scenes. I laughed, I wondered, I felt alive watching this (and I even cry). Wonderful job to everyone involved in the show. Thank you."

I was so pleasantly surprised.The show is life-affirming and emotional. Whilst at times the guys seem a little too intrusive and border on being overly judgemental, they win me, and the people they're there to help, over with their charm, friendship and emotional support. Their chemistry and friendship brings a smile to my face and really is magic. The way they allowed others and themselves to open up was a privilege to see, and I have come away from each episode with a smile on my face. Definitely worth a watch, the first episode with Tom had me beaming, sobbing and awwing. A true delight."

      "content": "Although the show is very uplifting and is pushing to be inclusive in all areas, I do find sometimes the guys can be a little intrusive and displaying quite a bit of toxic positivity at times. While they certainly mean well and don't try to change anyone - instead enhancing all aspects of the people's lives to make them more confident and think for themselves rather than constantly helping other people - I cannot help but think what it would be like for me to go on that show.As someone who is depressed, has Aspergers and does not own a lot of money, I don't exactly have much in common with so many of the contestants that appear on this show. I'm also not all together a very nice person, nor can I pretend to be happy all the time.I had recently read Jonathan Van Ness's autobiography - and the way he presents himself in that book is almost completely different to the one in the show. He is a cheater, a drug abuser, a depressive, and someone so starved for his independence and for money he had once resorted to prostitution - which made him profoundly miserable. He's also very passionate about his goals, very honest, loving, funny and grateful. And all of that is brilliant.Someone should tell these guys that it's OK not to be OK - that flaws are good, that messing up is alright and that we all human and different in the end. They honestly should strive for the notion at perfectibility doesn't exist. Not all this crap about 'You're gorgeous, you're fab, you're a queen... bla bla bla'."

The show has a good blend of inspiration and comedy at the same time as the guys have a very upbeat and happy personality. Now would I say some of it is kinda stupid? yes. But, stupid can be good right? And in this case it sure is. I would say out of all netflix original series, this would be on my top 5 no doubt. If you need a show with a lot of heart and comedy, Queer Eye is for sure one to watch."

The inclusivity, diversity and the respect for all of it is amazing. The way this group reaches out to not only expand people's views on what, for an example, masculinity is and can be, but also to expand their own mindsets about things, is truly priceless. This is a show of diversity, kindness and spreading joy, and I love every bit of it.There's not a single episode that would've left me dry-eyed and there's not a single person I would not recommend this to. All in all, Queer Eye is 100% a show that is current and important, and definitely worth the watch."

I didn't need to worry however; it took a bit of time to warm to the new Fab 5, but I think this is a good series in the making. The new characters are interesting and I think the more we get to know them the better it will be. I also like to see how the makeovers affect not only the recipients of them, but also the individuals in the group. I think there is a risk of the 'lessons learned' approach becoming a bit heavy handed though, and hope the production team don't labour this too much. At a time when there is a lot of bile and hatred spewed out in the media, its refreshing to watch a programme which advocates acceptance and tolerance. The Fab 5 are so lovely, treating each participant with kindness and humour without putting them down or humiliating them in any way. I can't wait for the next series and look forward to getting to know each of the Fab 5 a lot better"

I genuinely end up caring about them AND the people they are helping, which says a lot.I specially love Johnathan. I think a lot of the show spark comes from him having his moments, which I see some people don't like because of gay stereotypes but I feel that's just his personality, he is not forcing that, so it shouldn't be a problem (as being \"flamboyant\" is not supposed to be a bad thing in my pov, it's only bad if together with arrogance which Johnathan never has). Also, feels forced to say the show is perpetuating a gay stereotype by having just ONE of 5 gay men with this kind of personality."

I have not known many gay men who are at that level and I blame that for the initial hesitance. Now after several episodes and listening to his podcast (Getting curious) I see and understand his side of life. Antoni is a bunch of hot cuteness but he is pulls his worth in the kitchen, helping out the ones spice up their life (yes, intended pun LOL). Bobby has such good taste in how he sets up the interiors of places and I have yet to dislike any of the rebuilds, want to buy all his stuff. Tan breaks out a sassy English/Pakistani representation and scrapes the clouds with his never wilted pompadour cut, his style is as sharp as his intelligence. Karamo is a gift, yes, he's sexy but what's even better... he's smart, compassionate and throwing down the psychotherapist realness in the talks with folks, teaching without making anyone feel down. May this show be on for many seasons... there are lots of folks out there that need a touch of wonderful and caring in their lives and QE brings it!"

      "content": "I had no interest in seeing the revamped version of Queer Eye which I assumed would be more of the same, and I see enough snarkiness on Twitter. Of course I was dead wrong as my huge fan daughter showed me. The warmth, love and respect the Fab Five show the weekly subject is life-affirming. I know that editing is showing me what it wants me to see but it apparently wants to show good people doing good things with joy and acceptance while allowing the very diverse group of guests learn to love themselves. Colorful, funny, kind and great design and clothing advice - what's not to like?"
