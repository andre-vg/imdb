In contrast to the original series, which was filmed in the New York area, the first two seasons of the reboot were filmed in Atlanta and neighboring Georgia towns. Production moved to Kansas City, Missouri for the third and fourth seasons (beginning production on June 16, 2018), Philadelphia for the fifth season, Austin, Texas for the sixth, and New Orleans, Louisiana for the seventh.\r\nDavid Collins has said that he is interested in filming a season of Queer Eye in the Midwest, and that he would like to bring the Fab Five to his hometown, Cincinnati, Ohio: \"I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio, born and raised. I would like to go the tristate region, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, because you can base in Cincinnati and go across the bridge to Kentucky and go up the interstate to Indiana. The corn-fed midwestern folk are where I'm from—and I love actually being from Ohio, it's a great place to be from.\" The Fab Five later voiced fictionalized versions of themselves in an adult animated series, Big Mouth.\r\nRelease\r\nAll eight episodes of the first series were released on Netflix on February 7, 2018. Netflix's provided maturity rating is TV-14.\r\nThe series was renewed for a second season that aired on June 15, 2018. Speaking to Variety, interior design expert Bobby Berk stated that season 2 was filmed at the tail end of season one. The season features a new theme song by Betty Who. The season includes an episode focused on a man named Skyler who is transgender. Other makeover heroes include a Walmart employee, a young musician, a mayor, a woman, and a man trying to graduate college.\r\nOn June 6, 2018, it was reported that an episode was being filmed in the town of Yass, New South Wales in Australia. Yass was chosen due to the fact that \"its name matches one of the boys' favorite sayings: 'yaass'\". On June 21, 2018, the 20-minute Yass episode was released online.\r\nIn June 2019 the series was renewed for a fourth and fifth season. The fourth season was released on July 19, 2019. A four–episode special season called Queer Eye: We're in Japan! was released on November 1, 2019. This special season also features Kiko Mizuhara as the Fab Five's Tokyo tour guide, and Naomi Watanabe makes a special appearance. On March 11, 2020, Netflix renewed the series for a sixth season to be filmed in Austin, Texas. On May 14, 2020, it was announced that the series' fifth season would be released on June 5, 2020, and would consist of 10 episodes filmed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The sixth season was released on December 31, 2021. The seventh season was released in May 2023.\r\nEpisodes\r\nSeries overview\r\nSeason 1 (2018)\r\nSeason 2 (2018)\r\nSpecial (2018)\r\nSeason 3 (2019)\r\nSeason 4 (2019)\r\nWe're in Japan!

I’ll be thinking of the fact that I am a representative of so many things that have been so negatively portrayed over the last three and a half years… We want to be respected.

When there was some controversy around the video where some criticised Taylor Swift for being opportunistic in her public allyship, Tan France spoke up in support of Swift, calling her a \"powerful ally\".",

The cast recorded a video with Jill Biden and advocated for Joe Biden to be the next U.S. president. In the video, the cast comments on the Trump administration and argues that Biden verbatim will be able to minimise the impact of but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic, homeless veterans, environmental issues, trans and black lives.</p><p>Tan France was also vocal about his opinion on Trump's immigration policies. \"What I will be thinking when I'm voting is… first, oh gosh, I feel a bit emotional. I’ll be thinking of the fact that I am a representative of so many things that have been so negatively portrayed over the last three and a half years… We want to be respected. Muslims want to be respected, people of colour want be respected, the Black community wants to be respected, gay people want to be respected, trans people want to be respected.\"</p><h4>Lizzo x Queer Eye Music Video — \"Soulmate\"</h4><p>The Fab Five appear with American singer and rapper Lizzo as animated cartoon characters in her music video for the song \"Soulmate.\" The music video was released at the end of June 2020 in celebration of Pride month.</p><h4>Taylor Swift Music Video — \"You Need to Calm Down\"</h4><p>The cast also appeared on Taylor Swift's \"You Need to Calm Down\" music video in June 2019, along with numerous other queer celebrities. The song and music video was portrayed as a celebration of the LGBTQ+ community and the music video ends with a call to sign a petition supporting the Equality Act which would protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. When there was some controversy around the video where some criticised Taylor Swift for being opportunistic in her public allyship, Tan France spoke up in support of Swift, calling her a \"powerful ally\".</p><br/>"
