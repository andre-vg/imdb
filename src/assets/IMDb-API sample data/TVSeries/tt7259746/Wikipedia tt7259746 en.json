Production moved to Kansas City, Missouri for the third and fourth seasons (beginning production on June 16, 2018), Philadelphia for the fifth season, Austin, Texas for the sixth, and New Orleans, Louisiana for the seventh.\r\nDavid Collins has said that he is interested in filming a season of Queer Eye in the Midwest, and that he would like to bring the Fab Five to his hometown, Cincinnati, Ohio: \"I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio, born and raised. I would like to go the tristate region, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, because you can base in Cincinnati and go across the bridge to Kentucky and go up the interstate to Indiana. The corn-fed midwestern folk are where I'm from—and I love actually being from Ohio, it's a great place to be from.\" The Fab Five later voiced fictionalized versions of themselves in an adult animated series, Big Mouth.\r\nRelease\r\nAll eight episodes of the first series were released on Netflix on February 7, 2018.

Other makeover heroes include a Walmart employee, a young musician, a mayor, a woman, and a man trying to graduate college.\r\nOn June 6, 2018, it was reported that an episode was being filmed in the town of Yass, New South Wales in Australia. Yass was chosen due to the fact that \"its name matches one of the boys' favorite sayings: 'yaass'\". On June 21, 2018, the 20-minute Yass episode was released online.\r\nIn June 2019 the series was renewed for a fourth and fifth season. The fourth season was released on July 19, 2019. A four–episode special season called Queer Eye: We're in Japan! was released on November 1, 2019.

The cast recorded a video with Jill Biden and advocated for Joe Biden to be the next U.S. president. In the video, the cast comments on the Trump administration and argues that Biden verbatim will be able to minimise the impact of but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic, homeless veterans, environmental issues, trans and black lives.\r\nTan France was also vocal about his opinion on Trump's immigration policies. \"What I will be thinking when I'm voting is… first, oh gosh, I feel a bit emotional. I’ll be thinking of the fact that I am a representative of so many things that have been so negatively portrayed over the last three and a half years… We want to be respected. Muslims want to be respected, people of colour want be respected, the Black community wants to be respected, gay people want to be respected, trans people want to be respected.\"\r\nLizzo x Queer Eye Music Video — \"Soulmate\"\r\nThe Fab Five appear with American singer and rapper Lizzo as animated cartoon characters in her music video for the song \"Soulmate.\" The music video was released at the end of June 2020 in celebration of Pride month.\r\nTaylor Swift Music Video — \"You Need to Calm Down\"\r\nThe cast also appeared on Taylor Swift's \"You Need to Calm Down\" music video in June 2019, along with numerous other queer celebrities. The song and music video was portrayed as a celebration of the LGBTQ+ community and the music video ends with a call to sign a petition supporting the Equality Act which would protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. When there was some controversy around the video where some criticised Taylor Swift for being opportunistic in her public allyship, Tan France spoke up in support of Swift, calling her a \"powerful ally\".",

The cast recorded a video with Jill Biden and advocated for Joe Biden to be the next U.S. president. In the video, the cast comments on the Trump administration and argues that Biden verbatim will be able to minimise the impact of but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic, homeless veterans, environmental issues, trans and black lives.</p><p>Tan France was also vocal about his opinion on Trump's immigration policies. \"What I will be thinking when I'm voting is… first, oh gosh, I feel a bit emotional. I’ll be thinking of the fact that I am a representative of so many things that have been so negatively portrayed over the last three and a half years… We want to be respected. Muslims want to be respected, people of colour want be respected, the Black community wants to be respected, gay people want to be respected, trans people want to be respected.\"</p><h4>Lizzo x Queer Eye Music Video — \"Soulmate\"</h4><p>The Fab Five appear with American singer and rapper Lizzo as animated cartoon characters in her music video for the song \"Soulmate.\" The music video was released at the end of June 2020 in celebration of Pride month.</p><h4>Taylor Swift Music Video — \"You Need to Calm Down\"</h4><p>The cast also appeared on Taylor Swift's \"You Need to Calm Down\" music video in June 2019, along with numerous other queer celebrities. The song and music video was portrayed as a celebration of the LGBTQ+ community and the music video ends with a call to sign a petition supporting the Equality Act which would protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. When there was some controversy around the video where some criticised Taylor Swift for being opportunistic in her public allyship, Tan France spoke up in support of Swift, calling her a \"powerful ally\".</p><br/>"
