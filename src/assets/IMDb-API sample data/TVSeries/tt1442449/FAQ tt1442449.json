      "question": "What happens to Marcus Crassus?",
      "answer": "At the end of the series: He survives, barely escaping a fight against Spartacus himself. His army defeats the rebels. However, Pompey steals credit for the victory.History says that Marcus Crassus was given the province of Syria to Govern. But due to his need to compete against Pompey Magnus and Julius Caesar in terms of military victories, Crassus decided to invade Parthia. The King of Armenia even offered Crassus assistance of 40,000 troops if he but invaded through Armenia. Crassus refused and decided to take a more direct approach by crossing the Euphrates. Crassus' troops were nearly massacred by the Parthians due to their fighting technique, which the Romans were not trained to defend against.Subsequently Crassus' men, being near mutiny, demanded he parley with the Parthians, who had offered to meet with him. Crassus, despondent at the death of his son Publius in the battle, finally agreed to meet the Parthian general; however, when Crassus mounted a horse to ride to the Parthian camp for a peace negotiation, his junior officer Octavius suspected a Parthian trap and grabbed Crassus' horse by the bridle, instigating a sudden fight with the Parthians that left the Roman party dead, including Crassus. A story later emerged that, after Crassus' death, the Parthians poured molten gold into his mouth as a symbol of his thirst for wealth. Or, according to a popular but historically unreliable account that it was by this means that he was put to death."

      "question": "Why did the show end after only 3 seasons?",
      "answer": "Steven S. DeKnight stated on a commentary for an episode of War Of The Damned that he originally planned for 5 seasons. However, DeKnight felt that the story he wanted to tell could be told in 3 seasons (technically 4 if you count Gods Of The Arena). The first two seasons ended as planned. Seasons 3 and 4 would have been the slow build of Spartacus' army and defeating other generals that he did battle against, with the Romans scheming and plotting against each other. Marcus Crassus intending to be introduced in the third or fourth season. The fifth and final season would have seen Spartacus confronting Crassus. DeKnight felt that seasons 3 and 4 would have been repetitive and fairly similar in structure to the final season, so by the time Spartacus finally faced-off against Crassus, the story would be stale and uninteresting. Therefore DeKnight decided to skip right ahead to the final season of Spartacus having a massive army to do battle against Crassus."
