      "question": "Why did Rob McElhenney gain weight in season 7?",
      "answer": "McElhenney gained the weight to mock the vanity of his character, Mac, and because he was sick of seeing sitcom stars get better-looking as their shows age. He has no regrets about becoming the first actor to make a \"Raging Bull\"-sized committment for a TV comedy.Rob then got in to extremely fit shape for later seasons."

      "question": "Where is the front of Paddy's?",
      "answer": "A street sign says Second Street. In Philly, numbers are used and not spelled out, so I am guessing it's somewhere else. The set is the Starkman Building in Los Angeles."

      "question": "Is Dennis a sociopath?",
      "answer": "The show has never come out and said this, but it has been a running joke and strongly implied that Dennis is in fact a sociopath and the rest of the gang simply doesn't realize it. In the episode \"Mac Fights Gay Marriage\", Dennis says \"This is crazy, I'm having *feelings* again. Like a 14 year old kid or something. You remember feelings right?\". Mac, shocked says \"Are you saying you don't have feelings?!\" to which Dennis replies \"Well no, I'm saying I've built up a shell. A cold, calculating, heartless shell...\" Dennis is also shown to be a complete narcissist with no regard for anyone else and thinks of himself as a \"golden god\" and he often implies that he has disturbing sexual fetishes.Apart from it being hinted at all through the show, the closest we really got to knowing that Dennis was a Sociopath as well as more, was in the High school reunion episode (7th season episode 13). It happens when Dennis loses his temper because he gets rejected by a woman, this makes him totally lose his temper and he then rushes out of the school and to the back of his Range Rover, where the gang are already sitting. He then goes into the trunk, where he pulls down a secret hidden compartment in front of the gang. The hidden compartment has zip ties, strong tape, a video camera and a flash light in it. When questioned by the gang why he needs those things, Dennis still raging replies that he needs his things and that they are his tools and then when confronted further by Charlie why he has this weird stuff, he backtracks a little and says it's about his fetish urges of binding and being bound. So again it sort of leaves it open to debate weather he's a straight-up bad man or just out there a little."
