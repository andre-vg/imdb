      "question": "What types of cars are driven on this show?",
      "answer": "Bean's car is a British Leyland Mini which is more simply known as a \"Mini\". In the pilot episode, Bean drove an orange 1969 Morris Mini MK II but for the remainder of the series, he drives a yellow and black 1977 Mini MK IV. The infamous blue 3-wheeled car is a 1972 Reliant Regal Supervan III."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is the driver of the blue, 3-wheeled car and why does Bean have so many run-ins with the car?",
      "answer": "The identity of the driver in the blue 3-wheeled car is unknown but the car's numerous appearances on the show and Bean's competitive rivalry towards it is a running gag throughout the series. In the pilot episode, Bean steals the blue 3-wheeled car's parking space by rudely pushing the car out of its parking space using his own car. The rivalry between Bean and the blue 3-wheeled car seems to be hugely interpreted by only Bean himself as other driver never takes any offensive initiatives against Bean. (In fact, in one episode, the unseen driver of the blue car actually offers to give a stranded Bean a ride but Bean rudely ignores him.)"

      "question": "What is Mr. Bean's first name?",
      "answer": "There are several references throughout the original 1990-95 television series where Mr. Bean often had to include his first name on various formal documents, and always wrote \"Mr.\" in the \"first name\" bracket. In a 1993 Comic Relief skit titled \"Blind Date\", Mr. Bean is asked what his first name is, to which he replies \"Mister\". In the 2007 film \"Mr. Bean's Holiday\", Mr. Bean's first name is revealed to be \"MR\" as seen in a quick glance of his passport.There used to be a persistent rumour that Bean's passport in some TV show or movie gives his first name as Rowan, as in Rowan Atkinson, but no specific citations or screen captures have ever been provided to back up this rumour, so it is probably untrue. Bean's first name is still \"Mr.\""
