In <span>New York City</span>, struggling author <span>Mario Puzo</span>'s <i><span>The Godfather</span></i> becomes a best seller and is optioned for film by Paramount. It is negatively received by the Italian-American community, in particular <span>Frank Sinatra</span>, as it is believed the Johnny Fontane character is based on him. <span>Joe Colombo</span>, one of the heads of the <span>Five Families</span>, begins a crusade to fight injustice towards Italian-Americans, founding the <span>Italian-American Civil Rights League</span>. Due to the success of the novel, rival studios such as <span>Warner Bros.</span> call Paramount to try and convince them to sell the film rights. Evans is able to convince <span>Charles Bluhdorn</span> to retain them. He tasks Ruddy to produce, who selects Puzo to adapt and <span>Francis Ford Coppola</span> to direct. To intimidate them into dropping the project, Colombo has Ruddy's car shot up by <span>Mickey Cohen's</span> men.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep2\" style=\"text-align:center\">2</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Warning Shots\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Dexter Fletcher</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><i>Teleplay by</i> : Michael Tolkin &amp; <span>Leslie Greif</span> and Michael Tolkin &amp; Nikki Toscano &amp; Kevin J.

All agreeing on <span>Vic Damone</span> for the role of Johnny Fontane, they meet with him after he expresses interest and agrees to participate, though he later announces he will not do the film after being publicly intimidated during one of his shows. For the role of <span>Michael Corleone</span>, Coppola insists on <span>Al Pacino</span>, whom Ruddy promises to get despite being told by casting executive Andrea Eastman that Evans will never approve him. Evans goes to New York and instructs Lapidus to never interfere with him again. Ruddy meets with Congressman <span>Mario Biaggi</span> to be given permission to film in New York but is informed this will not be allowed. Evans is sent a dead rat in a copy of the novel by Colombo and he flees back to Los Angeles, where he learns he will be removed from his position at the end of the month.

He has his secretary Bettye McCartt steal what Puzo and Coppola have and bring it to New York. With the promise that the word \"mafia\" is eliminated from the script, Colombo gives his blessing for the film to be made. Coppola arrives to retrieve the script and is brought on a location scout where they find the home they will use as the Corleone home. In Los Angeles, Evans locks himself in his office and ignores calls from Bluhdorn to concentrate on the slate Paramount currently has. Bluhdorn finally gets hold of him and informs him he will not be fired, with Evans pledging that should <i><span>Love Story</span></i> and <i>The Godfather</i> flop, he will accept full fault. Glazer shows interest in helping Ruddy with producing, taking hold of one of the screenplays on his desk and accompanying him to the studio, where she pitches that Sinatra should portray Don Vito Corleone to Evans. Due to the stress from his pledge to Bluhdorn, Evans scolds Ruddy about Glazer as well as the length of the script and furiously rejects considering Pacino for the film without even seeing his screen test. Despite this and additional threats of cuts to the film, Puzo excitedly informs them that <span>Marlon Brando</span>, whom he wrote to about playing the Don, had written back and was interested in doing the film.

Ruddy and Evans discuss Brando, whom Evans cast doubts on due to his difficult reputation and his box office status, as well as again refusing to consider Pacino. Ruddy, Coppola and Puzo meet with Brando and record a screen test with him. Coppola travels to New York to show Bluhdorn the footage. He gives his approval on the condition Brando work for scale and comply with the studio. Evans angrily tells Ruddy to never go behind his back again. The backlash from the Italian-American community, as well as Sinatra and Biaggi, gives Bluhdorn and Lapidus reason to look at reigning Ruddy in to ensure the production doesn't get out of hand. In New York, Ruddy is able to officially get Brando signed on for the film but later that day Glazer comes to tell him she is leaving him and returning to <span>France</span>.

Having been at the office when Ruddy was told about the Staten Island home, Colombo has the homeowner picked up and intimidates him into allowing them to still film there, deeply unnerving Ruddy.

Colombo, meeting with the congressman in regards to the <span>FBI</span> raiding him, gets the permits reinstated. The budget, despite the cast working for scale and leveraging incentives, is still over the $4 million price, so Ruddy and Coppola meet with Bluhdorn and get the budget increased to $6 million.
