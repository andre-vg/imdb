      "question": "How is the show animated so quickly?",
      "answer": "Whereas most animated shows take six months on average to animate each episode, an episode of can be animated within days.This is due to a mixture of South Park (1997)'s simplistic animation and the fact that it is drawn and animated with computerized vector animation tools Maya and CorelDRAW. These two things put together allow it to be animated incredibly quickly and so episodes often have changes hours before airing. Using that software on South Park is quicker than other shows because the video can be rendered faster and full 3D video is not required for South Park's 2D style. Edit"

Prototypes of the four main boys in today's \"South Park (1997)\" are evident, although voices and names are different than today.Later, a TV executive commissioned the pair to make a video Christmas card, called \"The Spirit of Christmas (1995)\" (also know as \"Jesus vs. Santa\") where Jesus and Santa have a \"Mortal Kombat (1992)\" type battle to decide the true meaning of Christmas. Thanks to timely advice from Brian Boitano, the boys stop the two from fighting and save the day. The original video in its entirety can be seen either on the Internet or spliced into the episode \"A Very Crappy Christmas (2000)\".When Comedy Central got the video, they asked the creators to do their own show on the network. The original pilot episode is \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe (1997)\". Edit"

Randy also drinks a can of beer and tells Sharon that it is gluten-free, which is a callback to the gluten conflict of \"Gluten Free Ebola.\" Butters also returns to school and tells Cartman that he is no longer suspended.In \"The Handicar,\" Randy sings a Lorde song as he passes by on a handicar.In \"The Magic Bush,\" the Cissy bathroom is still visible in the school hallway.In \"Freemium Isn't Free,\" Randy scolds Stan for spending a lot of money on an app and explains that the fact that he makes a lot of money on his music is no excuse. He also drinks gluten-free wine.The next episode, \"Grounded Vindaloop,\" does not seem to have any continuity references. It seems to be out of continuity anyway.The episode after that, \"Cock Magic,\" has a scene in which Stuart McCormick has a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon gluten-free beer when Detective Yates visits him.One of the main focuses in the plot of \"#Rehash\" is Randy performing live as Lorde. It is mentioned that he has no choice but to do the concert since the Marshes lost a lot of money after Stan spent it on Freemium games.\"#HappyHolograms\" is a direct continuation of \"#Rehash.\" The holiday special is called The Washington Redskins' Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special, a reference to season premiere \"Go Fund Yourself,\" during which the main characters made a company called The Washington Redskins and had a dispute with the actual Washington Redskins football team. Randy says that he will tell Shelley that he is Lorde \"one step at a time,\" a reference to a line from \"Freemium Isn't Free.\" Twitter usernames include @lordyLordeLorde, @ShakeWeightFan, @FullBushBro, @cisginger1, @fraichefan, @glutenkillz, and @cockmagic4life. These are references to \"Cock Magic,\"\"The Cissy,\" season 14's \"Crème Fraiche,\" \"The Magic Bush\", and \"Gluten Free Ebola.\" A family calls customer service, a callback to \"Grounded Vindaloop.\" When Cartman is trending and \"transcending,\" he says that he is now transgender and that \"now they will HAVE to give me my own bathroom.\" This is a reference to \"The Cissy.\""
