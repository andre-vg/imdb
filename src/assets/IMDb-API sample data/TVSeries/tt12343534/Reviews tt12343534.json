      "title": "With Jujutsu Kaisen, MAPPA has struck gold once again.",
      "content": "Months ago, when I had first heard of Jujutsu Kaisen and its \"similarities\" with Bleach, which is one of my all-time favorite anime shows, I was very curious and the subsequently growing hype just added to the excitement. And as I finished it in merely two days, I was left very impressed and entertained to the core. Jujutsu Kaisen is MAPPA's striking new achievement which has set the bar for action anime shows, very high and hard to top.At first, the concept revolving around the talisman sounded very original, unique and seemed like something the whole thing would revolve around. That's where I was slightly surprised, since the show didn't follow it entirely and instead also focused on different characters, meaning the protagonist Yuji Itadori was not allowed to completely dominate the show, which is rare. Rather, his teacher and an absolute fan-favorite Satoru Gojo stole the show with his cool heroic moments, many of which can send a shiver down your spine! For a secondary character, he truly gets to shine a lot, and other characters one can actually expect to great primary treatment, mainly Itadori's friends Nobara and Megumi, too shine when the right time comes.The plot initially moves at a very fast pace, leaving little to no room for characters to grow on you easily. However, that is achieved later on as we get introduced to them again and again through the skillfully drawn, beautifully colored and overall masterfully crafted action scenes. Every fight sequence is executed with intensity and the right usage of music and colors just adds to the brilliance. I was very impressed with the usage of red, blue, white and black, in the last few episodes. MAPPA surely knows how to adapt a manga faithfully and breathe life into the story by using colors adequately and artistically.Plus, while it's also a lot gorier than I imagined, given this is still a shounen, even moments of gore seemed more like abstract art instead of mindless violence, which is a rare feat to achieve. Jujutsu Kaisen has strong characters, both male and female, and are used effectively throughout the 24 episodes. There's some humor too, as expected from any shounen, and it doesn't disappoint. But it's mostly the fight sequences that stand out as the show's biggest highlight. This is a pure action anime, so while some of you might have issues getting into the plot initially given the fast pace and nonstop action, it will slowly cast its spell on you and the effects will be visible in no time. Just make sure to grab some popcorn and beverages (something I unfortunately couldn't) before you sit down to binge this supernatural action thriller. You're in for one wild ride!"

Jujutsu Kaisen shows potential and good promise from its initial episodes.Hunting spirits/demons/evil things have been part of anime since times old, but that doesn't mean Jujutsu Kaisen is any way boring. Good execution of the story has kept me going through the episodes with eagerness to look forward to what's coming up. Along with instances of amazing action-animation sequences and decent characters, it is notable to appreciate the first opening and ending themes, having a nice taste of funk.A pleasing and interesting start. I'm not surprised this anime is an adaptation of Weekly Shonen Jump. The magazine has often led to manga-adaptations that are worth giving a watch.A good watch for Shonen-enthusiasts. Hasn't been disappointed as of yet. Looking forward to Jujutsu Kaisen during its run."

I want to punch Jonpei the face every time he appears, the most tedious character I have ever seen i genuinely sleep every time he appearsThe writer introduce characters out of nowhere with really impressive powers and he talks about his life but it didn't matter at all, I mean what the point of knowing Kento's past? His was boring as heckThere's is no mystery here, everything is explained right away, the shifting humans could be more vague. Explanations during fights either by the person themselves or somehow the opponent figured it out(with Conan's level analysis)Yuji is hilarious and funny every time I await for him to show up on the screen. The art is amazing and comedy is spot on it didn't feel out of place The fight were really amazing with cool maneuvers and ideasLots and lots of talking, fighting, stop to talk, fighting, stop to talk but with explanation for what happened before and then more fighting but with a cool plot twist>> end fight and it almost it ends with one opponent escaping.Maybe I didn't appreciate the Anime because i did not read the manga?It wasn't a waste of time but at the same time I wouldn't watch it again. I'm sorry."

However, Yuji discovers that he has inherited magic and is able to control this power without interference from Sukuna. He joins the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College to consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, which will enable a full exorcism to take place that will free him.The anime is nothing short of a masterpiece.It has amazing fight scenes.

      "content": "(First time watching)The start of the show is really good, it picks it up straight away while explaining the complications very well so you don't fall behind. Some episodes I did feel jumped ahead a bit randomly but nothing bad. The characters are really good. They are quite likeable and each have there own back stories...besides Itadori, the main character, whose life before really wasn't explored. The other two...em...dark dog boy and hammer girl stole the show for me as they had interesting character arcs with great redemptions throughout the show. The villains were pretty standard, nothing all that negative to say...they are powerful, challenging and cool to look at, but again with lack of character arcs. The plot of the show is pretty good aswell, it has a really strong start and mid section but fades out towards the end with some major pacing issues. The ending was kind of bland in my opinion, I don't really want to watch more, it was pretty random. But the action was cool...all the action in the show is, probably the biggest selling point really. It's fast, fluid and filled with unique spins and ideas of how to fight. The wacky cast of curses also allows an even wider range of moves to can be used by both heroes and villains. To conclude the show is excellent and it does deserve the praise it is getting. I have my opinions as I'm sure everybody else does and I give it a 7/10 gud job!Edit: (second time watching) previously (the first paragraph) was my first review of this which I gave 7/10 but after rewatching it in Japanese( which might have made a difference) I can say that I enjoyed it a lot more. Maybe I wasn't focusing the first time, but the story had so much more meaning...it flows extremely well and has a consistently fast pace which is perfect for this type of show. The show also never runs out of ideas, every villain, every character is unique and has different powers which allows for so,e incredible action scenes. I also found the comedy much funnier this time around, I have no clue why but it was just far better this time! And that's why I movie it form 7/10 to 9/10! Far better the second time!"
