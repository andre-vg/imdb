      "question": "How is Michael not simply fired?",
      "answer": "Michael's continued presence is justified for several reasons. For one thing, Michael is shown to be a brilliant and very successful salesman and negotiator on several occasions. Also, Michael is the manager of Scranton, which is shown to be Dunder-Mifflin's most consistent branch, to the point where David Wallace begs Michael to tell him \"what (Scranton) is doing right\". Several minor characters also make it clear that, despite his antics, Michael is nowhere near the worst person in his position (i.e. Buffalo manager Craig/Josh Porter). In addition, Michael is the sole reason Dunder-Mifflin won the deposition case when Jan sued for wrongful termination. Michael sided with the company, saving the financially strained business upwards of four million dollars."

      "question": "Are some parts of the show improvised?",
      "answer": "Yes, but not as often as some believe. Many scenes seem improvised mainly due to the way they were written and/or acted, but it was confirmed by Jenna Fischer on her blog that a very large portion of the show is scripted. One of the more famous improvised scenes is the Michael/Oscar kiss in the episode \"Gay Witch Hunt\" (which Steve Carell decided to do while cameras were rolling), and Dwight's question to Toby about the female anatomy in \"Sexual Harrassment\" (Rainn Wilson added a few more questions for Dwight to ask)."

      "question": "Why does Michael hate Toby?",
      "answer": "The origin of their feud is never revealed, but there are several hints through out the series...-As the HR rep, Toby is mainly responsible for, and is the only one who has any power to, put an end to Michael's \"fun\" ideas and innovations in the office.-Michael mentions in one episode that Toby is a corporate hire and its shown that Toby answers directly to New York. Thus, Michael could resent Toby as the only one in Scranton with any direct authority over him.-Michael frequently chides Toby for his divorce. As a child of a divorced family, it's possible Michael may harbor some resentment toward Toby for this. This could also be the case because Michael is shown to get along very well with Sasha, Toby's daughter, and he knows what it's like to be a child of divorce.-Toby, at times, tries to act like a parental figure to Michael. Considering it's strongly implied that Michael had an icy relationship with his stepfather Jeff, it's possible he could view Toby in a similar light.-It seems to be a bit of a Dunder-Mifflin \"tradition\" for managers/bosses to despise their HR reps. For example, David Wallace complains several times about Kendall, the HR rep at corporate. Additionally, during their respective times as managers, both Jim and Andy are annoyed by Toby despite generally getting along with him otherwise."
