It's not just the stars who make this show good either, the supporting cast are all just as funny as the main characters. It was universally thought of as the best sitcom on tv while it was on and now thought of as one of the best sitcoms in the history of television. The show wasn't quite as good after Steve Carell left but that's only because the seasons with him are so good. It's still a good show after he leaves, just not all-time good like when he was there. I still watch all the reruns when they're on and they're still just as funny after numerous viewings as they were after one."

      "title": "A timeless sitcom that never gets old",
      "content": "The Office is a mockumentary style sitcom that is loosely based on the British sitcom of the same name. One of my all-time favourite movies is 2008's \"Get Smart\" starring Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. Despite being a massive Steve Carell fan, I only started watching The Office in 2022.The creative team behind the hit 2005 series \"The Office\" knows the characters extremely well and can flesh out each character's arc in a meaningful way. Each character is given separate personality traits and a rich and layered backstory. Most of the characters are multifaceted with endearing and often eccentric quirks.The writing of the series is impeccable. It wasn't written for the early 2000s time period, rather is meant to be topical and funny decades after it aired. I love how the writers manage to sneakily include jokes even in episodes with a rather serious subject matter. Each episode manages to maintain the series' excellent momentum and comedic timing.Mindy Kaling, BJ Novak, Paul Lieberstein, and Michael Schur all pulled double duty and managed to both write and act on the series. It is particularly surprising and amusing that Paul Lieberstein who portrays Toby Flenderson wrote Michael Scott's iconic and hilarious insults to the character. Michael's bitter rivalry with Toby is one of the highlights of the series. \"Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called and it appears you wet the bed again. So, you need to go home and wash your sheets because they are all yellow and wet with your urine.\"Steve Carell as Michael Scott is the obvious standout of the series. His goodbye episode was extremely poignant and emotional, which further exemplifies Steve Carell's stellar acting. After Steve Carell departed the show in season 7, the series declined in quality and took a significant nosedive.The ninth season is far better than the disastrous eighth season, but still does not have the same charm and wit as the seasons starring Steve Carell. Fortunately, the final five episodes of the ninth season reclaimed its title of being televisions no. 1 comedy. However, one aspect of the eighth and ninth season I will never forgive the writers is how they completely butchered the Andy character. They made the character unlikeable and the most hated figure on the series. Heck, Andy was even worse than Nellie to some extent.Jim and Pam are one of the best television couples, and the chemistry between John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer is palpable from the start. I'm glad that John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer are friends in real-life, and even asked the casting director and producers if both landed their respective roles. One of my all-time favourite Jim and Pam moments is when Jim gives Pam the DVD with all the highlights of their relationship. That was an incredibly emotional scene which made me cry. Also, Jim and Pam's wedding was bittersweet. Specifically, Jim's plan to marry Pam secretly without being overshadowed by the wedding guests is beautiful and one of the most romantic moments of the entire series. The closing shot of them at Niagara Falls is utterly beguiling. Jim and Pam are hands down my OTP of the series and perhaps also in general.Final verdict: 10/10."

The show not only makes you laugh, there are some heartwarming moments, and there are some moments where you didn't see coming. And you know another way how 'The Office' is an fantastic show? The show was still good when Michael left! An huge part of The Office left, and it still was great! I've seen the ending of the office, and both times cried (And proudly so), because during the show, you fall in love with the characters, you relate to them. Basically, what I'm trying to say is, it's worth the 21 minutes."

Really rooting for some, but also rooting against other, and really loving to hate some of the quirky characters. And when the show is all said and done, you love them all. I miss them.Easily re-watchable. This is a classic. This one will be played out in VR I'm sure when were all plugged into some computer."

I still get upset when it is over and already wonder when will I start again.The humor is wonderful. The characters are a great creation. All of them! They all bring something special to the show. Of course Michael Scott is a special one. And when it comes to Dwight Shrute I think he is one of the best in sitcom history. We also get some romance with Pam and Jim or Dwight and Angela.The actors are great at their performing and on time humor. When we start the characters don't seem to have so much depth. But with time we start seeing how sweet Michael and Dwight are. All the little moments when we see Michael be in pain make us love him more and more. He is a guy who wants not only to be loved but to love. This is how he treats his office as his best friends or children.And the great thing is that the show is on high level until it's very end. Even after Michael Scott leaves. Many say that it went down after, but even if it did it wasn't that far down. It still brought us a lot and I am glad they made those seasons. I liked all characters, except for Nellie and that was only for the short period of time when she was a manager. Now that was a disaster idea but they luckily saved it within a few episodes. And the end... The last episodes of the show are so emotional! They really made a great and successful effort to give the amazing show the ending it deserves. And I wish it was still going on..."

I watched all the first 7 seasons inside a few days and I wondered how this show kept me so relaxed and wanting more and more from these characters as the story lines kept me hooked on the ever changing plot. The writers have marvellously twisted the flow of the show adding suspense, a little bit of drama and romance and a whole lot of insanely funny pranks, jokes and it really bond us with the characters. And something I felt unique about this show is that how we felt for Michael when he was desperate with his life although we hated him when he was a nuisance and he added something to the show that I find unexplainable.So this is one heck of a show and I recently found that Billie eilish had watched this show 12 times! (worth it)."

The show depends on great dialogues, one liners and Steve Carell.To name a few, I liked S4E8 and Threat Level Midnight episodes a lot!!Michael Scott's character carries the show on its shoulders. After Steve Carell's departure, I find it difficult to binge watch all the episodes. That's my opinion!! Some people liked the show after Steve but few episodes were becoming excruciatingly long and boring. But still there were some gags and laughs.Must watch!! Everyone for sure will like it. My personal favourites are one liners and how Michael jokes around with every character like Oscar, Daryll, Stanley etc."

I'm working my way through Series 3 and have series 4 and 5 to look forward to. It's amazing how much the writers can get into 20 minutes. I like it when there is a double episode. I too am so glad there is no laughter track (which has stopped me watching quite a few comedy shows). I have noticed in this third series that the camera can be very annoying when it whizzes from character to character - far too quickly. Completely unnecessary. Steve's \"Michael\" conveys so much about the character - he's full of himself but so vulnerable and anxious for friends. Rainn Wilson's \"Dwight\" is just brilliant. And I love the company name - \"Dunder Mifflin\"!"

      "title": "Wonderful series",
      "content": "A documentary film crew is tasked with recording the daily lives of the employees of the Scranton branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The employees turn out to be a wide assortment of characters.I was never interested in the US version of The Office when it was first released: in fact it has taken me 15 years to watch it! I am a big fan of the UK version and figured the US version was just an Americanised rehash of the UK version and wouldn't do it any justice.Initially I was proved partially right as the Season 1 largely followed the UK series' plot, down to some of the scenes and jokes. It was still very good though and showed enough originality to make me continue watching. I'm glad I did.From Season 2 the series finds its own way and what a way it is! Cleverly, charmingly funny but what sets it apart is the emotional and dramatic side. There are some wonderful story arcs and sub-plots, not least of which is the Jim-Pam story. This really is the spine around which the series is built, especially in the earlier seasons. Their story is an incredibly engaging one, made even more captivating by an incredible, off-the-charts-level chemistry between the two actors, John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer.This is not to say that the other characters and actors play second fiddle. Steve Carrell is fantastic as the boss Michael Scott - very funny and perfect for the role - as is Rainn Wilson as Jim's nemesis, Dwight Schrute. Even the secondary long-term characters have their chance to shine, there is that much breadth to proceedings.Some of the shine did go off the show when Steve Carrell left. Will Farrell didn't work as a temporary replacement. However, the James Spader-Ed Helms period was great and saw the series almost back to its best.In the final season you could see that it had run its course though. There was never a bad episode but the comedy didn't feel as fresh and clever as before and the emotional side was missing. This was all made up for with a brilliant, nostalgic, emotional final episode that brought everything full circle. Fantastic way to end a series."

      "content": "Honestly, I thought show as 'boring' even before I watched a single episode. Seriously, what interesting could happen in an office environment? I remember first scene I saw from this show. It was from an internet wallpaper with Michael Scott with a white board behind him saying \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take\".Then after years from that, I somehow started watching \"The Office\", I don't really remember why I did that. What I love most about this show is it's raw nature. The camera is kind of shaky yet still brings the best scenes...something that I had never seen before in a TV sitcom. It may seem less professional but adds real life, personal touch with the TV show and the characters in them.Obviously, Michael Scott is one of my favourite character. Jim, Andy, Dwight, Pam, Erin, Kevin, Oscar, Angela, Creed and even the camera crew include in my favourite list.What I learned from this show is that it's okay to be weird and different ,that you won't be welcomed as you wanted it to be ( remembering Michael Scott attempts ), that you can't wait and expect things to happen for you, that it's okay to be hated and feel hate to others....it's all dependent on time. People change, feelings change, situations change. All you got to do is be yourself and be true to your heart and everything will fall into it's place.I love every minute I spent on this show <3"

Getting Michael back for Dwight's wedding was an awesome surprise and I always liked how they had some nice human situations in the show.Great run and love having it on."

The office manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is a good hearted if somewhat delusional and insensitive boss.What drove it in the first year is the office romance between Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer). That allowed the audience to get to know and fall for the rest of the office mates. The acting, the writing, the comedy, the chemistry all work together to produce one of the best well-made comedic shows of all times. The only bump in the road is the departure of Steve Carell near the end of season 7. Sure it had been grinding down over the years, but the departure really left the series rudderless. It lasted 9 total seasons. It was very reminiscent of other shows like Cheers where the characters became family."

      "content": "After reading all of the horrible reviews coming from the UK, I felt the strong desire to comment. I learned that most of the reviewers bashing it have only seen a few (at most) episodes from the first season - many haven't seen it at all, and are simply bashing it because of an overwhelming sense of pride in the original. I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. This whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty. The casts of the US and UK versions love each show. Ricky Gervais even wrote and executive produced a few episodes of the US version. Open your minds, people! Most of the US fans KNOW that it's based on a British version. It has gotten the credit it deserves for being a brilliant and hilarious show. But the American version is also brilliant and hilarious. I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version. I've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable. As for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with. This is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much. These three shows get better with each viewing and are great because there's so many levels of humor, from the apparent outrageousness to the minute details that are noticed after repeated viewings and are often funnier than the surface material."

      "content": "I saw Ricky Gervais' British first version of The Office first and I really liked it. I was septic that there was going to be an American version and I completely zapped it because of that. So it's only in 2016 that I thought I give the American version a shot and oh am I pleased I did that. I loved it so much I watched the entire nine seasons in only a month. I was completely addicted to it, so I was actually sad that they wrote this series off because to me it could stayed on forever. It's just an excellent show. I mean, if there are people that don't think this show is funny then they just don't have the right sense of humor. Every single character brings it's own touch to the show and they are all good. The pranks between Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute are a delight to watch. The 9 to 5 I-don't-care-about-anything office mentality from Stanley Hudson is just so recognizable. Kevin Malone and his craving for food, with his nerdy look, is just hilarious. Michael Scott, the man I would absolutely hate in real life, is so irritating in his character but yet so funny to watch. Andy Bernard, the guy that just don't get it but that desperately tries. Pam Beesly, one of the only \"normal\" people in the office, her flirting with Jim, also a delight to watch. Meredith Palmer, the slut of the office, every office has one of those, lovely to watch. The eternal love-hate relationship between Kelly Kapoor and Ryan Howard. The poor poor Toby Flenderson, hated by almost everybody in the office, even though he tries to do his best to please every-one. Angela Martin, she acts like a nun but deeply she's completely different. Oscar Martinez, the gay of the office, also one of the \"normal\" people from the office. Phyllis Vance from Vance refrigeration, a name I will always think about when I see refrigerators. Darryl Philbin, great to watch as well. I really loved every character in this series, but my favorites are Dwight, Kevin, Darryl and Michael. I love the way of filming. A bit like in Parks and Recreation, where as soon as the character says a punchline he stares at you into the camera for a couple of seconds. Just love that kind of cinema. It works really well to make it funny. Anyways, I'm so sad it's finished. If you never saw it I can only recommend it. You won't be sorry."

I remember looking forward to the American version when it first came out and being disappointed immediately to the point that I refused to watch it after the first episode. Almost 6 years later I gave it another go as people were telling me that it was actually quite good. I took the advice that I should start from season 2. This time around I enjoyed it more and gradually warmed to the characters that were basically copies of the British version. I can't believe that I would ever say this, but this show is as good as the British version. The bonus is that there is a lot more of it. It was certainly a knee-jerk reaction to give up on it so quickly, but it seems that a lot of people did. The Jim/Pam relationship is a clone of Tim and Dawn, but some of the pranks that they play on Dwight(Gareth in British version) are quite brilliant. There are certainly differences between the two versions, but generally the American version stays fairly true to the original.If you loved the original, definitely give this a go."

      "content": "This show really is outstanding, in fact its the only show i think i can rate as a 10. From watching the original uk series back in 2001 on bbc TV, i never thought an American remake would stand any ground whatsoever. When the first series aired in the uk it did'nt really make its mark, and unfortunately never caught on. I was disappointed when it disappeared from our screens, and then quickly forgot about it. I thought it had 1 series and crashed and burned. Then one day i was checking out the reviews for evan almighty on IMDb and noticed that steve carel had still been making this show. I had to get hold of it and see it, And to my joy there was 5 series waiting for me. I never get into TV like i have done with this, i ended up watching 10 episodes in a day, i think i did all 5 series in just under 2 weeks. This show is funny, its acted brilliantly, its over the top, totally crazy but totally entertaining. If your ever down just bung on a couple episodes from good old dunder miflin in scranton and you cant go wrong. Gervais said that 2 series of the office in the uk was enough. And that he did'nt want to take it further. I know he helps on the US version, and i sure he is surprised to see 6 series already of what i can only describe as the best American sitcom of all time!!"

      "content": "The luscious saga of Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam, Janice, the whole ball of wax, is one of the great comedy successes of the past decade. It might not quite be Seinfeld, but it's close, and in its own way this revamp of the British TV show (with Ricky Gervais here as executive producer and occasional writer) is similarly groundbreaking. Almost all of the dialog is improvised- I think Steve Carell said once that he has an earpiece to feed him lines here and there- and the writers they do have for the show are some of the finest around (some crosspolination, if that's the word, from the likes of the Daily Show like with Larry Willmore). Plot - there are a bunch, as I am beginning to learn bit by bit going through the past seasons. Unlike many a sitcom, the storyline and continuity does matter, but if you were going into a random episode in season 2 or 3 you might be able to follow along. It's all about the characters, really, and how the personalities one grows accustomed to stay true even when things shift a bit.It's also a great time with the documentary form- not so much mockumentary, even though there are some days where the camera crew get some looks thrown their way, be they 'turn it off' or 'get a load of this!' And, of course, all the players are brilliant. Steve Carrel has become a full-blown star thanks to the show, and it reveals a lot of his depth as an actor (yes, they give Michael a soul from time to time, aside from being the incredibly awkward-inducing-feeling boss at Dunder Mifflin). A lot of times you get the feeling you're seeing Michael say something to the camera-person he's said before, but no matter what it's still hilarious, because Michael is a sincere fellow. What that means for his co-workers is something else (ever watch \"Diversity Day\"? or Sexual Harassment day? or all the days?). At times you squirm in your seat like in a grand-guignol horror movie, as everybody else, relatively more normal than Michael (or not, as case might be) are stupefied by the extremes Michael will go to. And yet Carrel can also pull it off fantastically when actually being somewhat human, adding that side that doesn't make him just a complete jerk. It's tricky, and it's why he's always never going to be dull on the show. Ditto for Rainn Wilson, who can keep the same deadpan expression all the time and knock it out of the park. A lot of times just seeing him get a prank pulled on him is like watching a sun rise- the most beautiful thing imaginable (shall I compare Schrute Farm Beets to a summer's day?). And Jim and Pam, aside from the facet of a relationship on TV that isn't contrived or put through the wringer, seems to be just another piece to the ensemble, not a dominating factor like it might be on another show (and contrary to how the buzz was beforehand, the two of them hooking up ends up not being the most fascinating crux of the show - Mike and Janice, on the other hand, whew!) So, The Office...one of the great comedy shows...not much else to say...get back to work!"

When you watch him you know there are a bunch of people like him in the real world and his parts were the funniest.Also, this series was one of the rare beautiful things in my life in the last few years. Today I watched the last three episodes, which was so hard to do. I cried about five times in these three episodes. I really gonna miss them."

I think the laugh effects are unnecessary because I have to decide for myself where to laugh.Anyway, this series reflects the office spirit very well and the characters and actors are incredibly good. I identified with all of them. Although I love each character individually, my favorite character (even though I didn't like it at first) is andy. I can laugh at him even if he does something stupid. There are very few TV shows that I watch with a laugh, and the office has certainly succeeded in being one of them. Definitely you should watch it soon..."

Michael Scott, Dwight Schrute, Andy \"the narddog\" Bernard... The list goes on forever. They are all so well played.Superb humor, that suits everyone. It's dumb, stupid, and so loveable. Have re-watched it so many times, I might actually beat Billie Eilish on a the Office quiz. I envy you if you still haven't watched it. Enjoy!"

      "content": "For the past several months since I dropped my cable company and picked up Netflix I've been watching The Office. Practically everyday after work and after finishing what needed to be done I'd watch several episodes and have done so from start to finish. I have been captivated by every character and to watch their personalities develop I almost had to ask myself if this was really a TV series or a real documentary. Even though the characters were slightly dramatized, I had coworkers or friends that had similar traits to 'almost' all of them so that made it even more personal. Having just watched the last episode I was surprised on how sad I became to not be able to come home and see what new adventures the office was going to go through. The show was very captivating and really pulled you into their lives. I think the people that don't like the show probably didn't start from the beginning and only watched several episodes because, to be honest, after the first several episodes of the 1st season I was going to stop watching it but I'm glad I didn't.Having watched a 9 year 'documentary' in several months really puts a perspective on life and just how short it is. Watching the last episode and seeing everyone's reaction to seeing each other again really hit home, and how you should appreciate the time you have because it goes by so fast. You could even see how the characters aged slightly over the years although the makeup probably made it seem less than it really was I would think.In the end, I'm really glad I took the time to watch the series in its entirety...between the bouncing relationships, clever/brilliant pranks, it was all very enjoyable :)"
