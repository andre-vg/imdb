      "content": "You may argue that you've seen better shows than \"Gullak\" but just once, just once try remembering the last time you enjoyed any series watching experience so much.Rarely in a lifetime, we come across a play, show or a movie which becomes instant relatable and that absorb it's audience so much so that we just want to be there for little more time. Gullak is that gift to India and it's viewers by TVF & Gullak-Team. High on acting, punchlines and perfect writing, this show in it's second season slightly deviates from the light hearted comedy drama that was seen in season:1, dwell more into the emotions of Misra Parisar in season:2 but without losing the track of humour. The brotherhood of Annu-Aman in season:2 if relates to you, tears & smiles are guaranteed. As usual, Misra Pariwar & Bittu ki mummy runs the entire show but this time, Annu is the Big Bull of season 2 in all departments.I genuinely feel the makers must continue the Gullak series for many more seasons and hoping that, if any actor becomes a big star tomorrow they will still find dates for Gullak shooting and continue doing this show. Because you four people (Papa, Mummy, Annu & Aman) bring so much smile and emotions out of viewers that you have no idea about.I just wish the kids of 2020s generation are watching this series and when they go in 40s/50s, they will find themselves remembering the memories of 20s and \"Gullak\" will be one of that (Like sometimes we float in 90s nostalgia)Best wishes to Team Gullak."

Gullak is such a simple story about everyday life of a middle class family. Their fights, struggles, love etc... These characters are so real, you might even relate with them. Every episode is a \"kissa\" like the series told in the beginning not a \"kahani\". There is not Sacred Games or Mirzapur, but a peek into everyday life of a family with a humorous touch. I will really recommend everyone to watch this series."

      "content": "Gullak season 3 is a comedy drama family show directed by palash vaswani and amrit raj gupta. These are the positives and negatives.Performances:-oh where do i start? Jameel khan is extremely underrated as an actor. He has poured so much innocence into the character that it seems real. Geetanjali kulkarni is again excellent. The mothers of middle class households are the most difficult to play and she has aced it. Vaibhav raj gupta is my favourite of the lot. He brings the sense of security and maturity in the household many a times. Harsh mayar is naive and equally excellent. The performances are brilliant to say the least.Music and background score:-the intro theme is pure love. I guess no one would even dare to skip it. And the songs composed are no less. They are melodious and so insightful. The lyrics are so well written.Dialogues:-nothing to talk about dialogues. Just the everyday things we all talk about in middle class homes. But it feels so good to see that. Just normal conversation nothing unauthentic or crass. And the humour is brilliant. Brilliant dialogue writing.I think there is no need to say more. Gullak is an emotion which needs to be felt. Just watch it. It is sweet, subtle and a masterpiece. I rate it 10 out of 10."

      "content": "Life is a simple journey and yet we make it complicated. Few folks makes life harder trying to seek happiness in more luxurious way of living while few enjoy the moment in small things. From the house of TVF Play, Gullak is probably one of the best web-series to come out which is completely entertaining, beautifully scripted with natural performances by the star cast.While we got introduced to the beautiful world of Mishra family in Gullak Season 1 where we witness what happens in typical Indian middle-class - quarrels, fights, struggle, conciliate, facing budget-constraint, pulling each others leg and yet accepting and being there for each other. Season 2 deep-dives into each character of Mishra family which takes the story forward.Thanks to the OTT platform, small town stories have become the flavor of the season. While movies and web-series have made audience adore the simplicity of these places, the culture followed by locals with no flashy and grandeur sets makes it real enhanced by situational comedy to watch since you might never know what will come next and the surprise element that will make you laugh-a-loud. This is where Gullak scores. The web-series is intrinsic to its core right from the beginning with hilarious moments enough to tickle your funny-bone. Few scenes will definitely bring down the house as the we see Mishra family rib-tickling dialogues.There is something about TVF's content which will touch the right chord of your heart. The team behind impeccable dramas like Permanent Roommates, TVF Pitchers, Flames, Kota Factory, TVF's Tripling , Cubicles etc, Gullak is yet another feather on their cap which is beautifully directed by Palash Vaswani and Amrit Raj Gupta and cleverly written by Nikhil Vijay (2019 Season 1) , Shreyansh Pandey and Durgesh Singh. Technically, the cinematography capturing the beautiful locales of a small town while art direction is simple yet powerful. While I would recommend to watch the Season 1 to get the feel of Mishra family's household environment, Season 2 does have emotional and heart-warming scenes.The chemistry between Papa (Jameel Khan), Mummy (Geetanjali Kulkarni), Annu (Vaibhav Raj Gupta) and Aman (Harsh Mayar) is so real as if they are actually part of Mishra family. Each and every actor has played their part with aplomb. Voice of Shivankit Singh Parihar (Gullak) goes well running at the frequent interval. Sunita Rajwar as the troubling neighbor is brilliant as usual.So overall, Gullak Season 2 will make you believe and adore your family even more after watching. It is a fun ride all the way !!"

      "content": "TVF returned with another heartfelt memoir, encircling a traditional middle-class family. Although there isn't much for prevalent structuring; alternately they used short stories to make an imitation of all the little incidents that occur on a regular basis.Truth be told, I never felt happier while watching a web series before. A joyful smile was persistent on my face throughout the whole duration. Belonging to the akin middle-class background, can't help but notice how each trait had so much resemblance with our everyday lives.A grounded yet cogent appeal that not only leaves a mark but also helps you to establish an acquaintance with the on-screen family. That too with enough subtlety. Comprised of four main characters; they all correspond to every other household in our country.Coupled with some outstanding performances, sufficient technical competence, and an ethereal Soundscore; abounding contributions from all these critical aspects do make it even better. Regardless of petty flaws; I truly appreciate what I finally got out of this commixture! Where simplicity easily prevails in every plausible direction.Highly Recommended!(Streaming exclusively on SonyLiv)"
