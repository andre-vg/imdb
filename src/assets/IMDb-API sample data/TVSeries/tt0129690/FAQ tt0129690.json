      "question": "Who is Alan Partridge?",
      "answer": "Alan Partridge is a comedy character played by Steve Coogan. He first appeared on a radio show called \"On the Hour\" on BBC Radio 4. This then got a TV spinoff \"The Day Today\" which Alan was also a part of. The show was a spoof news show featuring Alan as the sports news segment host. Alan then got his own spoof chatshow on the radio, \"Knowing Me Knowing You\" which again got a TV spinoff \"Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge\". \"Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge\" was followed up with a double length Christmas special named \"Knowing Me Knowing Yule with Alan Partridge\". Alan starred in a short film which was made for TV called \"Alan Partridge's Country Ramble\" which is basically as the name suggests, him going for a ramble. Alan's next major project was this sitcom with him as the main character, \"I'm Alan Partridge\". It was followed up with a TV special \"Anglian Lives: Alan Partridge\", an episode of a fictional TV chat show with Alan as the guest. An Alan Partridge movie is was in pre-production but has been shelved for later due to it's plot being about terrorism and the recent London bombings. Amongst these TV appearences, Alan Partridge has made countless appearences on chat shows, presenting award shows and at Comic Relief."
