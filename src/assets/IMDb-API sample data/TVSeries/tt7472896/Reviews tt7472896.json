      "content": "Mr Inbetween brilliantly captures the raw underbelly of Australian society.The main character Ray is a man of two parts. One is a kind, generous and considerate rough diamond. The other a ruthless monster, who brutalises and kills, with a pragmatic, at times almost jovial, \"you had this coming\", coldness.The juxtaposition of conflicting yet at the same time oddly reconciled personality traits, that constitute Ray's complex persona, make for fascinating viewing. Ray slips with relative ease into and out of a world of pedestrian normalcy, into one fuelled by organised crime, violence and sudden death.It never ceases to amaze me how many quality productions come out of Australia. Mr Inbetween is yet another example. Well acted, intelligently written and ably directed. Great stuff from \"down, down under\".8/10 from me."

Second, I love the length of every single episode. Impossible to get bored. Last, the storyline is fantastic from begining till the end.So, overall better than 99% of Hollywood series. Amazing Aussie production."

I don't know anyone who's seen it that doesn't love it. The lead character (Scott Ryan as Ray) is both a tough guy who you shouldn't ever mess with and also a kind and good man. This show has something for everyone...it is funny, violent, thrilling, mysterious, etc. It's a show that should be binged because once you finish an episode you can't wait until the next one. If you haven't yet seen this underrated show then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as possible."

      "content": "As an Australian I don't always like our homegrown TV Shows and Movies but this one does Australia proud, so funny that I sat there laughing so hard it hurt.None of the violence is overdone and there is logic to all of the violence even if not everyone would agree with it. None of it is senseless for the sake of violence and it is well explained by the main protagonist. I really liked his principles.Like another reviewer has stated this show is in a league of its own, nothing I have seen compares to this, Scott Ryan was just brilliant as the main character, a complete unknown to me. Justin Rosniak is another complete unknown, Damon Herriman is well known from Justified and always does a good job. Brooke Satchwell is always nice eye candy and did a good job. Matt Nable is another I am familiar with and he played his normal understated character that I am used to, always like seeing him in shows.This show easily gets a 10 from me, just under 3 hours of very entertaining TV, easily watched in one sitting, which I was lucky enough to be able to do."

      "content": "Two episodes in and already I'm a fan. The whole \"thug for hire\" premise suggested this would be a dark show - gritty and serious. Not so. It's actually fairly lighthearted, especially considering the subject matter, and that makes it a fun watch. The cast is largely unknown - at least in the US - but I enjoyed Damon Herriman for years as Dewey Crowe in Justified, and he brings a lot of that Sad Sack charm to this new role. This show isn't going to sweep the Emmys, but it's a pleasant way to kill half an hour, and it has the potential to become a bit more than that.And for those reviewers who complained about the Australian accents, close captioned (subtitled) versions are available on most of the torrent sites.This is an UPDATE - I haven't changed any part of my original review except the rating.I wrote my original review after only 2 episodes, and after having watched the entire series I changed my rating from 8/10 to 10/10. This show really did live up to its full potential - screamingly funny at times (in a dark way), but remarkably poignant as well, especially when addressing Ray's family issues. I'll be keeping an eye on everyone involved in this production to see what they do next..."

The likability of the characters is never forced. And while the story can be a bit brutal , again it's not forced. In fact there are so many levels of nuisance even my partner (a psychologist who is super picky and doesn't like violence ) watched every episode.I would go so far as to say it's exceptional. We already miss having something of this caliber on our watch list."

Yeah it pays hommage to some classics ,so obviously,its out of respect. Why someone would give this a 3 is pretty illuminating. Same people that didnt like Dunkirk. Hopefully the show gets the support to continue developing this great aussie tv show. The subtlety is lost on some people. I'd ask,why did you watch it? For everyone else ,,toatally addicted.

      "content": "Gritty show from Australia which I found quite believable, unlike shows in the vein of Ray Donovan etc. Having known a few people in my time on earth that actually made a living from crime and violence, I found the portrayals realistic. There is no glamorized violence, kung fu, CGI BS or 90 pound women in high heels and evening dress beating up 220 pound thugs, so if that fake Hollywood world is your thing, this is not for you. In the real world, people are multi-faceted, and this show does a good job of presenting that with the main character. I am not Australian, but I didn't need subtitles to understand the dialogue. As for the reviewer who said the main character is a rip off of Mike from Breaking Bad, you are wrong. The lead in Mr Inbetween is a direct recreation of the lead role in The Magician, 2005, an Australian movie. Scott Ryan wrote the movie and played the lead, and he is a writer on Mr Inbetween and also plays the same character. Note Breaking Bad didn't air until 2008, 3 years after The Magician, so if anything, Mike is a rip off of Ray Shoesmith.Don't miss this show if you like realistic action, settings and characters. If you like Hollywood and typical UK PC police procedurals, you might not like this. Personally, I found Mr Inbetween a breath of fresh air."

I can see how some people might find the accents and the slang terms a little difficult, but if you can get passed that, the show is amazing. It's one of those shows that I'm always sad is over, I want more episodes and longer episodes, the people and characters are fantastic. I'm surprised they put it on FX, but I'm so glad they did. I'm just hopeful that it's popular enough to warrant more seasons and popular enough in the U.S. that they continue to show it over here. If you're already tuned in for the SOA spinoff, check this show out, you won't be disappointed."

A tough guy (really tough, incredibly tough, cold-blooded-tough, killer tough) has a heart of gold (or close to). Which doesn't stop him from bashing the bad guys. But does keep him from bashing those bad guys who are somehow worth saving.He's got a girlfriend who suspects he may be more than merely tough. He's got a daughter who adores him (and rightfully so). He cares for a stroke victim (at least I think it was a stroke), he shows up at his kid's soccer matches, he takes anger-management training, and he's his best-friend's avenger. I mean, What's not to like?I said he's a basher. He's a really good one. But also he's smart. Smart enough to know which of the bad guys is dumb enough to fool. And when he can fool them, he does. Leaving them embarrassed, ashamed, perhaps poorer. But ... alive.So with each and every episode we move between Mr. Soft and Mr. Hard and back to Mr. Soft and so on and so on. And even though we know what's coming, I never get tired of it.As for its star / producer Scott Ryan. You gotta love his portrayal. You gotta loved his smile, his sneer, his boiling over. Never does he fail to deliver."
