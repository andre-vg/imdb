      "title": "Hip-hop stir-fry samurai action..",
      "content": "Samurai Champloo is the long-awaited next project from Cowboy Bebop director Shinichiro Watanabe. His two short films in the Animatrix compilation (Kid's Story and Detective Story) give American audiences a sneak peek at the phenomenal art style of this series, but they barely hint at the jaw-dropping action and unorthodox blend of history and music contained therein. The similarities with Bebop end at the fact that the series has three protagonists: the vagrant swordsman Mugen, the rogue samurai Jin, and the tea-shop waitress Fuu. This unlikely and volatile trio begin a road journey through post-shogunate Japan (ca. 1780), brought together by circumstances best seen to be believed. \"Champloo\" means mixed-up or stir-fry, and that's what this series is: a stylish blend of old school values and situations, meshed with more modern sensibilities, fighting styles, and visual design. Over the lush, dynamic art, a soundtrack of some of the best hip-hop from modern Japan plays. Though it's a noticeable device in the first few episodes, it doesn't take long before the music feels like second nature despite the anachronism.Champloo is many things: a mature drama, an action series, an uproariously funny comedy and a visual feast. Watanabe-san demonstrates here that the success of Cowboy Bebop was uniquely his, and no fluke - fans of that series will not be disappointed, despite how radically different the two story lines are from one another. As the title card of the first episode of Samurai Champloo says, \"Just shut up and watch.\""

      "title": "Kickass anime neoclassic",
      "content": "With 1998's \"Cowboy Bebop\", one of the most acclaimed anime TV series ever (go read the comments index for it here on IMDb if you don't believe me!), Shinichiro Watanabe became a creative force to watch out for. The innovative energy, drama and beauty of \"Bebop\" are carried forward in his second original series, \"Samurai Champloo\". Fans have been quick to look for similarities between \"Bebop\" and \"Champloo\" (even the titles have clear parallels), and it's true there are some: the assembly-of-rootless-loners cast of characters, the dramatic and cinematic visual style, and especially the importance and integration of music into the storytelling mix--in SC's case, everything from hip-hop beatboxing to Ainu and Okinawan folksong. But \"Champloo\"'s differences from \"Bebop\" are much more interesting than its likenesses. \"Bebop\" is drenched in melancholy and regret, dreams of the lost past and the future that couldn't be. \"Champloo\" is all about facing the future, the wave of change, the onrush of history that can't be stopped, and how three kids from widely diverse backgrounds--not even friends when they set out-- find themselves right on the crest of that wave. We're in Edo Period Japan; since 1638 the Tokugawa Shogunate has banned contact with all countries except China and Japan, a ban that lasted two centuries. The outside world can't be kept outside forever. Even the long-respected samurai class is losing its power, and there's restlessness in the land plus accompanying pressure from the Shogunate on all sides. Through this uneasy landscape (rendered in lushly beautiful watercolors that might remind you of Miyazaki) wander our cast of characters: outlaw ronin Jin, a gifted swordsman, stoic, disciplined and heartbreakingly gorgeous, devoted to the bushido code but exiled for killing his sensei; Okinawan wild-boy Mugen, orphan, former pirate and brilliant innovator, whose fighting style mixes everything from Brazilian capoeira to break-dancing, and whose feral-child innocence faces the toughest tests in the series; and teahouse waitress Fuu, spunky, compassionate and packing a lot of secrets, who rescues the two swordsmen from the executioner's block and enlists them on her quest to avenge her mother's death. On their long walk from Edo to Nagasaki they'll see a lot, face a lot of trials, starve, quarrel, save each other's lives, break up, re-bond, and become inseparable. Except that Jin and Mugen still swear they'll fight to the death one day, and no one (not even Fuu) is saying anything about the Sunflower Samurai, the object of Fuu's quest.Have I made this sound like a straight historical drama? I ought to mention that it can be hysterically funny as well as vividly bloody, contains knockout fight scenes and anachronisms by the carload (the aforementioned break dancing and beatboxing, Jin's Armani glasses, the appearance of landmarks not built till the 1900s...), has made me cry more times than any anime since \"Bebop\", and has sharp things to say about the heavy hand of authority and tradition on groups as diverse as gay men, married women, foreigners, aboriginal natives and illegal aliens. It's unfailingly beautiful to look at (well, 95% unfailingly) and listen to, delectably well-written, and simply brilliant. When it gets to America, go find it."

      "title": "Absolute Anime Brilliance!",
      "content": "I was at Best Buy one time checking out the anime section, there I found Samurai Champloo for sale. I am a big fan of samurai anime so I took a look at it. Two things made me want to buy it: the dream team of director Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop & The Animatrix), designers Kazuto Nakazawa (Kill Bill Vol. 1: Chapter 3: The Origin of O-Ren), and Mahiro Maeda (Last Exile & Blue Submarine No. 6), and an awesome, hard-hitting hip hop soundtrack! There aren't many animes that have rap soundtracks, so I had to check this out. Samurai Champloo is one of the best new animes. Brilliant animation, memorable characters, laid-back kinetic atmosphere, great music, and kick-ass Hong Kong, Akira Kurosawa style fight sequences. The story revolves around two highly skilled ronins and a girl: Mugen, a violent, buck wild swordsman whose style emphasizes one hand kendo and Capoeira. Jin, a mysterious, calm gentleman swordsman that masters traditional, straight-forward Japanese Swordsmanship. And Fuu, a young, beautiful ditzy waitress. After Fuu saves them from being executed, Mugen and Jin agree to temporarily set aside their differences and help her in her quest to find the \"samurai who smells of sunflowers. Jin and Mugen are the perfect examples of the yin-yang concept. These unstoppable, independent warriors are complete opposites, but their skills are equal to each other. Fuu plays a perfect mediator between the two. This series has strong ties to Watanabe's previous classic, Cowboy Bebop: same style action and atmosphere, but with a hip-hop soundtrack instead of Jazz. And Mugen, Jin, and Fuu could be compared to Spike, Jet, and Faye. But what makes this series original is the hybrid combination of a feudal Japan setting and philosophy with modern fighting, urban street flavor personality, and off-beat comedy, hence the title \"Champloo\", meaning stir-fry. The verbal exchanges between the three heroes are amusing and great to watch. They series also utilize rap DJ record style scratching to switch between scenes perfectly. Overall, Samurai Champloo is an anime bond to be a classic, and raises the level for anime. If you are a major anime fan, check this out, it will be an excellent addition to a collection.***** (5 stars) Ryojin20 favorite!"

      "content": "Let me begin by saying I am a huge Cowboy Bebop fan. Spike Spiegel is my hero, okay? So as much as I was dying to see this new work from the mind of Shinichiro Watanabe, I was apprehensive from the standpoint that I didn't want to see any subsequent work destroy any luster or afterglow that Bebop left behind in its wake. I was downright scared, I mean, how can you mix samurai action with hip-hop? I know Bebop's atmosphere of 1940's noir and 2071 spaceships didn't seem possible at first, but I was proved wrong by that. Maybe Watanabe-san had stepped too far outside the box this time.I'll just come right out and say it: Shinichiro Watanabe can make anything he dreams up work. ANYTHING.Samurai Champloo is one of the absolute coolest series I have ever seen. And by ever I mean live-action, animated, whatever. \"Ever\" ever. If you like anime, this is required watching, a new classic for the medium. If you don't like anime, watch this and you just might start to.The story centers around two rogue samurai and the girl they're somewhat assigned to protect. Fuu, the young damsel who always seems to get in and out of distress; Jin, the serious samurai, and Mugen, the samurai who's seriously un-serious. The three travel around Edo-period Japan in search of the mysterious \"Sunflower Samurai\". And if I told you any more than that, I'd ruin so much of it for you. Just know this - the first episode will hook you like Tyrone Biggums to crack.If you're a fan of anime or Cowboy Bebop or just really bad-ass shows/movies in general, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. You can pick up the DVDs or just check it out Saturday nights on Adult Swim.Oh, and if you watch Adult Swim regularly and haven't caught Samurai Champloo yet, shame on you. You should know better."

      "content": "This anime tells the obscure story of 2 samurai bound to a girl on a quest for a samurai who smells of sunflowers. She constantly conceals her motiviation for doing so.The comedy element in this anime is excellent. A deliberate pairing comparable to Spike and Jet in cowboy beebop exists with one vagabond samurai and one honorable samurai. Both samurai have a completely contrasting fighting style which makes for great action scenes and simultaneous plots (where one is fighting on one side of a city and another is fighting on the other).Similar plot style to cowboy beebop, via meetings with people from their past, both characters pasts are slowly revealed with a clear direction toward finding the samurai who smells of sunflowers. There's a constant struggle to find the basic necessities like food and a real feel to the plot as opposed to anime where you're left wondering if they've gone six months without a shower or a bath.As i said, best anime i've ever scene, hilarious :D"

      "title": "masterpiece",
      "content": "\"Samurai Champloo\" is perhaps one of the best shows in the animÃ© genre that I've ever seen. It is the masterpiece born from the artistic mind of ShinichirÃ´ Watanabe (famous for his work in \"Cowboy Beepbop\"), Kazuto Nakazawa, and Mahiro Maeda.Set in Japan's Samurai Era (1200's-1800's), this show tells the tale of three people: Jin, Mugen, and Fuu. Jin is a ronin (wandering samurai). Calm, cool, and skilled in the art of the sword. Mugen is hot-tempered and has a short temper, the exact opposite of Jin. When these two warriors are nearly executed, they are saved by a tea shop waitress named Fuu. In return for her help, the two warriors promise to help her find \"the samurai with the smell of sunflowers.\" The two agree with Fuu, and they go on this journey, beginning an exciting adventure as well as long and fateful friendship.\"Samurai Camploo\" is one of the best animations taking place in Japan of olden times, not to mention among the best in its genre. The animation is gorgeous. The lightning and shading is mesmerizing. Also, the painted backgrounds are lush and draws the viewer in. Watanabe really shows his skill as an animator in this one. The animation is one of the best features in this show. It has one of the best stylizations in anime. The atmosphere rocks.The story lines, too, are great. Set in feudal Japan, this show does a great job of showing the life and times of ronin samurai at that time. From the the peasants, to the prostitutes, to the gangsters, to just about everyone, this show has a graphic depiction of Japan during its Samurai Era, when the warrior was the dominant force in everyone's lives. The show even goes to show what type of clothes they wore, what houses they lived in, and what food they all -- all accurately. Only the Japanese know how to portray their history graphically.Speaking of graphic, this show in realistic in terms of real. It includes some profanity (although minor) and goes deep into the underground world of the brothels. In Japan, animation is for everyone, not just kids, and this show in very mature. Its story lines are very complicated. Its issues are deep and meaningful. At times, some episodes are dark, even showing death scenes and bloodshed, but this is exactly what makes this show cool.Now, the soundtrack. \"Samurai Champloo\" features a hip hop and RnB soundtrack and incorporates some traditional songs. What makes \"Champloo\" so unique in anime is that it combines the modern with the olden, and this is why the show is cool. The hip hop beats in this period piece are nice to listen to and blends in with the Fuedal Japan setting. The word \"Champloo\" means mix, and this anime mixes the modern with the olden, from Jin having glasses, to the language of the characters; the people here (in the English version) speak in modern American slang and vernacular. And rather than downplaying the ancient feel of this show, this show still retains its olden times aspects.\"Samurai Champloo\" is a must-see for all fans of this genre and animation in general."

They could be no more different, and in fact one would gladly kill the other with the chance, but they are both reluctantly recruited by the ditsy teahouse waitress Fuu after she saves them from execution.Samurai champloo is the story of Mugen, Jin and Fuu, as they journey across Japan trying to find \"The samurai who smells of sunflowers.\" All the way they meet all sorts of people, get into trouble, and try to make money. As the show progresses, the mysteries of the characters pasts are slowly revealed.Samurai champloo is an excellent series from the people who made Cowboy Bebop, the animated sequence in Kill Bill, and a few sequences in the Animatrix. The music is good, offering a wide variety of genres, the animation is excellent, and the dialog is kept to a bare minimum. Oh, and the comedy is great, too.If you liked Cowboy Bebop, you will probably like Samurai Champloo. One's set in the future and has a lot of jazz music, the other's set long ago in Japan and has a lot of rap in the scene transitions. But the character types in both are pretty much the same, and in both the characters must come to terms with themselves. I recommend it to fans of this genre of anime."

These two guys (one a Ronin, the other a criminal) are the characters I added without a thought to my \"best characters ever!\" list. The anime contains both funny and sad scenes without disturbing the ambiance of it. And the last episodes are so dramatic and tense that they will keep you on your fingertips until the end.

It may sound stupid but trust me its not.The animation. The animation on this show is Bebop quality. The animation is just incredible. The fight scenes are kick ass, beautiful and often times bloody. The backgrounds are very lush and detailed. You will be amazed and how good everything looks.Now on to the best part, the music. When I first heard about Samurai Champloo the first thing that came to mind was \"Well its made by the same dude that did Cowboy Bebop so its got to be good.\" ,the next thing was \"Well what does a Japanese man know about hip hop?\". Even though I'm still wondering about the second question, it doesn't matter because all the music works great. Just like with Bebop the series wouldn't be half as good if it didn't have the great music that it does. The opening theme song to Samurai Champloo is a \"rap\" song. I put rap in quotation because none of the lyrics rhyme so its not a true rap song, but its still great.Bottom line. If you are a fan of Cowboy Bebop you have to see this. In fact if your a anime fan at all you need to see this. This will go down in history as one of the greats along with Cowboy Bebop."

      "content": "A great story, but the ending feels off.Firstly, I am not a Cowboy Bebop fan... but this does put a smile on my face.There is no doubt that Samurai Champloo is a good anime. From the very start, characters and the story are well defined, and the idea of mixing 19-century samurais with hip-hop culture is rather well executed. The dynamic between Jin, Mugen and Fuu is very interesting and funny to watch, with the two swordsmen constantly being each other's opposite. The development of the story is quite fascinating: the main goal is always to find the Sunflower Samurai; however, everything that happens to the trio on the way is a result of them trying to find some food and get some rest. Some of the plotlines felt too real, as the matter of a fact, and the themes of violence, slave trade, gambling and promiscuity definitely provide the show with an appropriately dark undertone.On the-not-so-bright side of things, the last few episodes could have been done better. The show is all great and realistic up to the twentieth episode when I-do-not-know-what happens; and the baseball filler kinda ruins the tension we are supposed to get at the climax of the story. The character development is also a bit lacking; we know what Jin and Mugen are like from the very start, but little do we get to know them throughout the whole series. Also, how many cuts and bullets can one samurai take before they die? No spoilers here, but that question ruins the ending for me personally.All in all, give it a go - if not for the story in general, then for an entertaining and realistic way the 19-century Japan is presented."

      "title": "Gear up for the Japanese hiphop",
      "content": "The anime has the setting of the Edo time period of Japan and it is surprising how perfectly the Hip hop music matches with this kind of a setting. Not only the opening song, Battlecry gives you the elegant vibes, the other songs like Small Circle of Friends and San Francisco are just as catchy. Even the non-hip hop songs like Shiki no Uta, Who's theme and Obokuri-Eeumi in the Okinawan dialect give you the feelings of the 90s nostalgia. The OSTs which are played during the fight scenes or the deep conversations are really well made and perfectly suit to those respective scenes. Nujabes has been widely praised for the Samurai Champloo soundtrack and very rightly so. In terms of quality, this soundtrack is second to none(Okay, maybe second only to Naruto's). This anime has made me appreciate the Japanese Hip hop even though I have never found the conventional Western Hip hop interesting.Having the setting of Edo Japan, the anime has several historical references. While there is some accuracy in it, most of it is just for fun. The story revolves around Mugen, Jin and Fuu as they journey across Japan trying to find \"The samurai who smells of sunflowers.\" In their journey, they experience all sorts of crazy things, get into trouble and try to make money or find the means to survive as long as they are traveling together. As the show progresses, the mysteries of the characters' pasts are slowly revealed. The anime has a bittersweet ending. Once their motives are all achieved, the three characters go on their separate paths. Yet, it doesn't really intend to make us feel emotional. In an elegant manner and using the Hip hop style, they just ask us to carry on whilst playing the song 'San Francisco.'The characters are so damn interesting. I was shocked to see the character of Mugen. It was nothing like any other main character. As a self-taught and ruthless swordsman, he just doesn't know how to hold back. Not only is he arrogant but always looks to pick up meaningless fights and wouldn't mind brutally injuring or killing others. His past is beautifully explored though. You would understand from where he got such beasty personality. Jin has noted that it is surprising how a reckless and impulsive man like him is still alive. Despite traveling together and having minimum hatred for each other, Mugen and Jin wish to kill each other someday. Despite Jin being just as cold on a contrary, he is much wiser and calculating samurai. Rarely losing his stoic exterior, he doesn't bother sharing his past, his motives, his mysteries or even his basic feelings with Mugen and Fuu. He does however manage to fall in love with a woman, who taught him how to cook Eel. Fuu, despite being cheerful and a foody woman, too has her own motives. In fact, the main storyline of this show entirely depends on what she is upto or on the factors responsible for her actions or decisions. Fuu seems to be much more sensible than Mugen and Jin, something that allows her to trick even such cold men and make them work for her.Few episodes are only for the references sake. So don't be shocked when you see the main characters apparently dying just for them to appear well and alive in the very next episode as if nothing was happened to them. I am pretty sure most of the people won't take it positively. Nevertheless, the things that matter the most are fabulously done. For instance, the scene in which we see Mugen drowning and we get to see the glimpses of his past life. Not only was the scene emotional, nicely animated and perfectly executed, but the song Obokuri-Eeumi makes it look even more beautiful and deep. The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed as well. Some of those managing to trigger the characters' philosophies or deep thoughts really make the show look more interesting.The elegance of Samurai Champloo has managed to amaze me and even the ending was done in such a way that the completion of the anime feels totally satisfying. I will praise it endlessly but on the other hand, I will also have no complaints if it doesn't have the season 2."

      "content": "i don't see where all this \"best anime ever\"-style praise comes from. to be sure, \"samurai champloo\" is an enjoyable piece of lightweight entertainment, but its also seriously flawed.the good thing about the series is, of course, the animation, which is just gorgeous. especially the fight scenes are flawless and its worth watching the series for those alone. the character designs are quite cool too, with sexy mugen stealing the show. the sets and backgrounds are beautiful, too. the show is one amazing eye-candy.but the story is rather weak and slow. every episode has a little adventure or mystery which is enough to carry the episode itself, but those little adventures never have anything to do with the overall plot. and said overall plot, the search for the samurai who smells of sunflowers, is not only rather boring, but doesn't seem to progress at all. therefore, there is no suspense or momentum, no sign that the series is headed anywhere.so, is \"samurai champloo\" worth watching? it sure is - its pretty and its fun. but i don't think its the masterpiece everyone seems to have seen."

      "title": "incredible animation and hilarious/serious story",
      "content": "first of all, you have to understand that samurai champloo was done by Shinchiro Watanabe, creator of Cowboy Bebop. now that it's outta of the way, u can obviously tell this show will have hip-hop fusion along with great animation. Watanabe has done it again. This time, he heads toward the samurai-era with 3 wonderful characters. Jin(the passive, quiet, stern and traditional samurai master), Mugen (the hyperactive(jumps a lot), violent, and agile criminal/samurai), and Fuu(the calculating, crafty, and often persistent girl). Fuu saves Jin and Mugen's life and as a debt, they have to help her find a \"samurai who smells like sunflower\". it may sound average but believe me, this show is extraordinary. the fights are animated so fluidly(Kill-Bill-animation), the story is funny a s hell, and the music is \"interesting\"(rap opening). There's even beat-boxing in one ep. WATCH THIS SHOW!!! YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT"

      "content": "From start to finish, this anime gave me a good feeling, relaxing and yet it kept me interested and wanting for more. Cannot describe the feeling exactly but it was a real pleasure watching it, just pure happiness.The three protagonists, Jin, Fuu and Mugen are great and each has their own character which makes them a lovely trio. Animation is superb, that classic art style that sadly you don't see anymore. Story is interesting even though not much happens untill the second part of the anime, but I just love seeing feudal Japan in an animation, and just random things, you don't need to save the world every episode. Overall I would recommend this to absolutely anyone, it's a real gem."

      "title": "It's hard to get better than this",
      "content": "There are very few anime that I love more than Samurai Champloo. I find every bit of it perfect, from the OST, to the characters; and in my opinion, it's Watanabe's best work. So, to start off the review, I want to talk about the best part about the show.Easy the best part of Samurai Champloo are its characters. There are three main characters, Jin, Mugen, and Fuu. Jin and Mugen are both samurai, and that's the only similarity between the two. Jin's fighting style is quick and orthodox, whereas Mugen is erratic and unorthodox. Both also have very different personalities, Jin being calm and stoic, Mugen being devious and disobedient. Both characters complete opposite, but both being equally cool and likable. Fuu, is the character that holds Jin and Mugen together to help push the plot. She's bossy and naive, which plays well to her character.The plot of Samurai Champloo is quite simple; it's about the journey of three characters to find a samurai that smells of sunflowers. Samurai Champloo is all about the journey; who they meet and the stories that come with those strangers. My favorite episode is ep 11. It has all the best parts about Samurai champloo into one episode.The OST is one of the best in all of anime. It's lo-fi hip hop, which surprisingly works perfectly with the samurai theme. It's slow and calming, and when added to the melancholic atmosphere, you get a tone that you'd only get from Samurai Champloo.In the end, Samurai Champloo is one of the best anime of all time. Seeing the friendship build up between the characters each episode is so satisfying, and at the end of the show, it's bittersweet. Samurai Champloo is an anime that I'd recommend to someone who doesn't even watch anime, it's that good."

      "title": "For connaisseurs of anime mainly ... but still a major accomplishment",
      "content": "First some disclaimers. I came to anime late in life, not completely understanding the power of this art form in the right hands. I have since compensated for this untoward behaviour by watching about 50 of the genre, both full length and series, sequentially, in a very short period of time. Like, days. I am currently not sure what year it is, or what country I am living in, but I know for a fact that anime is no less an art form than the stuff you stand in line for at the museums. Second disclaimer, after watching this series, I made a beeline for Cowboy Beebop -- oops sorry for the pun -- but could not get past the first in the series. (This may or may not lend credibility to the other IMDb reviewers who maintain the two series are as different as they are similar?) Disclaimers aside, this is a wonderful treat, fun, action-packed, great music, fascinating themes, and a lot hidden irony (and other treats) buried deep in the dialog for those with very sharp ears. The characters, who form a brilliant ensemble cast, are as good anything in mainstream media. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE English AUDIO. The hip-hop sub-theme is fun, never too distracting. Highly recommended. FOOTNOTES: After watching a highly concentrated mix of Japanese and American anime, my conclusion is that the Japanese product is better crafted to an entirely higher order of magnitude. My favorite so far is APPLESEED, which, no coincidence, had, I believe, the strongest story line and script to support the wonderful animation. My criticism of Japanese anime generally is that the stories tend to be considerably weaker than the animation, leaving the viewer with an \"A/V high\" that last for a few hours, and then you forget why you liked the product in the first place. (oops) American product is better written, period. I consider the LAST AIRBENDER series, and the feature OVER THE HEDGE, to be two of the best productions ever done in America, regardless of genre."

      "title": "kick-ass samurai anime show; great story, cool characters, spot-on animation",
      "content": "Samurai Champloo (whatever a Champloo is I can't say) is one of those truly nifty late-night anime shows that pop up every now and again on Cartoon Network. It took a DVD viewing though, with four episodes back to back, to get a real taste of the storytelling panache that goes with the rugged saga of bad-ass samurai. The two main characters, one who is a little more scrawny but with enough power to kick a few heads in at once, and another who is more conventionally well-built but with a pair of glasses to assist in his travels, go through a series of events while on the search- by pay/bailing out/demand of a feisty girl- for the \"Sunflower Samurai\". While the revamp for American audiences includes a slightly annoying theme song (is it hardcore samurai anime or a basketball commercial?), there's always good voice-work going on, and an adherence to certain traditions that are a main-stay in samurai storytelling (the old samurai who feels his time is done and does seppuku after a card game; the ideal not to kill someone if there's no pay involved; grudges that come from the hot-headed never leading well; the feisty and strong-willed young girl meant to but doesn't quite match the guys). It's also a lot of fun; plenty of humor rests on moments that seem like they're meant in poor taste for laughs, like when the girl gets sacked- literally- by some guys who put her up to work as a slave/dancer in a bar. Or just in the attitudes of the main two samurai, who are ready at a moment's notice to fight one another, and begrudgingly stop because of hesitation or, of course, they get caught by some p-o'd warlord. It's a cool series overall, one of the best that's playing still from time to time on TV, and should be essential viewing for those that eat up action-filled anime like cotton candy at a good amusement park."

      "title": "Samurai Beat",
      "content": "What really made me love \"Cowboy Bebop\" was how it was able to mix genre, culture, style, and music that seemed almost like an unlikely mix but turned out to hit the right notes. It's done the second time around but directed this time toward the samurai genre and hip hop music, which on a side note I'm not a fan of either one but this show is one of the exceptions I make. And this is also another of my personal favorite anime TV shows.Unlike \"Cowboy Bebop\" this show actually does have a plot but isn't entirely concerned about it since it's really more of a motivation device. This is a show where style over tops substance.It's just great seeing an alternate version on ancient Japan which is a blend of both old and current customs making it all the more interesting and humorous. The hip hop soundtrack is awesome it really blends in well with the action and what currently happens as the show progresses. But of course as usual it's the characters and what they do that really drive it, their colorful and three dimensional enough for us to actually care about them.Mugen whom looks like he could be an ancestor of Spike Spegel is basically reckless, irresponsible, arrogant, tough, rough, not altogether bright, a rebel without a cause and has a bit of an inflated ego complex where he at times he brags he's killed lots of people though I highly doubt it is really everything he builds it up to be. Deep down though his heart is in the right place, he is capable of doing what is right whether he wants to or not. He sort of represents a more modern western school of action since his style of fighting is sort of your conventional swordplay mixed with break dancing.Jin who looks like actor Christian Bale is sort of the passive aggressive type. A man of very few words, he really doesn't say much in the show sometimes and when he does talk it's a very soft even voice. He's a silent rebel, doesn't bend to anyone and does the right thing when needed. He's represents the old school type of action since his style is based on the martial art Bushido, his moves are more precise but always quick as lighting.Fuu is naive in a good or bad way, worst of all seems to be a magnet for trouble even though she's not looking for it. She of course is sort of the mediator for the two, but whenever she turns her back both of them tend to duke it out. She's very sweet, feminine, smart'clever making her at times one step ahead as well as helpful or unhelpful for the two.The dynamic between all of them is sort of like any buddy buddy/buddy cop film, a road trip movie, or heck even a noir film since all three of them have hidden motives that we see as the show progresses. It's just fun and funny seeing the interplay between them all, despite their disagreements and grief they give one another subconsciously they are all close friends. Indeed it does show since despite the time both Jim and Mugen fight they never land one blow on one another as well as get untimely interrupted (may'be that's fate's way of telling them something). Both always work together to rescue Fuu whenever she's in trouble even though they didn't have to. All three of them seem to hold more conversations then the other people they talk to, but most of all they can trust one another the most. These characters really don't have anyone else in their lives which is why they mix; most of the people in their past or even present either have used them or betrayed them in some way.Dance to this Samurai Beat.Rating: 4 stars"

      "content": "I absolutely LOVED Cowboy Bebop. When I found out that Samurai Champloo was from Watanabe as well, I had to watch. HAD to. And I was not disappointed in the least! The artwork: stylish, lavish, colorful, detailed, and beautiful! As in Cowboy Bebop, this show isn't full of hot-bodied women with ridiculously childish features, cut-and-paste still frame fight scene accentuated with speed lines as in Yuyu Hakusho (I still love that show, however); it had a very realistic, emphatic feel about it. Another poster commented on the well-done fight scenes, and I wholeheartedly agree! As a participant in kendo and iaido classes, I recognized that almost every move in the fights were accurate and practical, true to real sword fighting.Characters: every single character was original, endearing! They each had their funny little quirks, their own personal issues that really makes you empathize with the characters. The voice acting is superb, both in English and Japanese.Overall: I love the way Samurai Champloo employs modern day hip-hop beats and certain personalities, entwining them with a feudal era Japan. While the storyline seems a bit flimsy and is peppered with perhaps 1 too many filler episodes, the compelling, gorgeous, artistic components of the show are like a slap in the face: it's fresh, it's funky, it's Samurai Champloo!"

This stands apart by it's ability to have characters that are relatable, skillful, and in control. It can be likened to the quality content of my youth.

      "content": "Fuu is a humble waitress when she finds herself in the middle of a battle between two samurai, who are battling a shared foe when they meet one another for the first time and start their battle of skills. Mugen is a wild warrior of little discipline but plenty of skill to match his arrogance; Jin is a disciplined samurai whose self-control only compliments his prowess with a sword. Sadly for them, their desire to fight to prove their superiority sees them captured by their foes and sentenced to death. Fuu rescues them but asks the condition that they put their fight to one side for a while and help her to find a samurai who smelt of sunflowers. They agree and set out on the road to their goal, with a dangerous journey ahead of them.I love the style of anime but I am not a massive fan of the genre and don't watch a great deal of it. The Samurai Champloo DVD's came into my mailbox with little in the way of fanfare, mainly because I know nothing more of Cowboy Beebop than the name, and so had no specific ideas about this series. The opening hip-hop grabbed my attention but I was also aware that this is all part of the style and packaging that the genre now has, so I didn't assume that cool credits would equal a cool series. The opening episode is a little jarring in the early stages as it cuts back on itself, makes \"errors\" in rewinding and other little gimmicks that distracted me, however these do not dominate any episode Â– they just stuck in my mind as they were part of my first impression and didn't totally work straight away. From here we join the quest, which is not really spoken of that much, allowing the series to be more episodic and about the adventures of the wandering warriors and Fuu.As a narrative this is perhaps not the most flowing way to go but one could say the same about the A-Team, Littlest Hobo or any series where a journey produces a different story each week within the same framework and approach. Some of the episodes are not that great but mostly they are enjoyable. The main reason for this is the characters, who are cool, funny and stylish in the way that all animated samurai are. The dynamics of the three characters work well and I found myself interested in them as much as any specific tale. The big draw though is of course the style of the series and in this regard it delivers. While it may be very much genre stuff, it is still very well done. The hip-hop music is not just plastered on but is mostly sparingly used while the visuals are impressive Â– and never moreso than in the fight scenes that are slick and exciting. As with many anime, it would be possible to freeze frame a lot of this stuff and hang it on your wall as a picture.As with any genre product, Samurai Champloo will perhaps not be \"good\" enough to appeal to a mass audience and it certainly will not win over those who simply dislike anime. However it is a fine example of the genre with an episodic narrative producing mostly good episodes, engaging characters and cool style for miles. Not perfect but enjoyable and cool throughout."

      "content": "This anime series follows Mugan and Jin; two very different samurai, who join Fuu; a young woman on a quest to find the 'samurai who spells of sunflowers. Mugan is a somewhat wild character with a brilliant but unconventional fighting style while Jin is the epitome of what a reserved samurai should be; these two unlikely travelling companions are travelling with Fuu because she saves them from execution in episode one. Their quest takes them through Edo era Japan and on their way they come across many interesting characters and various dangerous situations. It may come as a surprise but most of these encounters are also very funny.Coming from the creator of 'Cowboy Bebop' I should have expected something special but I was a little unsure if hip-hop in the time of the samurai would be anything other than silly as it turns out there isn't too much of that and what there is is frequently hilarious! The three protagonists are each great and distinctive characters. There is a fair amount of action; some of it fairly bloody and as the series approaches its conclusion there is an increased sense that the characters are in real danger. There are plenty of laughs to be had; usually due to amusing situations rather than gags and one-liners you might expect in a sitcom. There is a small amount of swearing, some of it in English, but not enough to spoil the series for older viewers the bloodshed already means the series isn't really suitable for youngsters to watch! The animation looks great with good character designs and backgrounds that seem to capture the feeling of the era. Overall I think this is a great series and heartily recommend it to anybody who enjoys anime; in fact I suspect even people who aren't usually anime fans may enjoy this.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles."

      "content": "Samurai Champloo is vastly overrated.The plot is thinner than soup. Character development is weak. We don't get to know Mugen's past until episode 13. For Jin, I think it started around episode 6, and Fuu, I don't even know - hers is very fragmented; little bit of here and there. Mugen was a potentially interesting character though stereotypical. Even they tried to expand on his past, it still didn't answer what I thought any reasonable viewer would wonder: how did Mugen pick up his unique fighting style? Jin has the best back story of the 3 and I have to say Fuu's past is the most vague or maybe she was too young and there was not much happening, she was only 15. Since there's little character development, I don't feel compel to root for any of them and that's why it makes the show less engaging. The show is also inconsistent in term of material quality. Some episodes are good, some are just plain silly, and others just had me stare blankly. Here are some bad examples:Eps.12 - The Disorder Diaries: the whole episode is a recap from eps.2- 10. I could skip this entirely and miss absolutely nothing.Eps.18 â€“ War of the Words: two thugs compete in graffiti in order to pet Fuu's flying squirrel.Eps.22 â€“ Cosmic Collisions: Zombies digging for treasure. And their only diet is wasabi. What?Basically, one episode is very loosely related to the next (except for the multiple part ones). You can literally watch just the first episode and then jump around randomly without missing too much.I feel like some romance in the end would have made it more satisfying. Mugen should have gotten together with that sexy undercover cop and Jin should get with Shino. Wait then what about Fuu? Never mind, I take that back. No romance is probably better.So enough about its downsides, here's why I still enjoy Samurai ChamplooThe show has a distinctive style and I like the hip-hop fusion. I also appreciate the producers' effort in incorporating real period of time and some historical events in the series. The soundtrack is dope (get it? hip-hop talk). The animation is good and the fighting scenes are quiet well choreographed. It's comical - Mugen sometimes made me genuinely LOL. The last 3 episodes were very good and they totally redeemed the whole show.Overall, Samurai Champloo is highly stylized and it has entertainment value despite some flaws. Most people will either love it or hate it."
