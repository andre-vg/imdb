Looking to make his mark, Ciro Di Marzio is tasked to burn the house of the mother of Salvatore Conte, a rival drug lord. After completing the task without hesitation and slowly gaining the trust of Pietro, the elder Savastano later entrusts Ciro to ready his son Gennaro to become the future head of the clan.\r\nFollowing a police check, Pietro is arrested and taken into custody; control of the clan unofficially passes into the hands of his wife, Immacolata, who deems Ciro and Gennaro unable to run the clan in Pietro's absence. Immacolata, who maintains a dislike for Ciro, orders him to travel to Spain in order to make-up with Conte and reunite the clans. She later tasks Gennaro to travel to Honduras, hoping his interactions with drug producers will fast-track his development into becoming head of the clan. Despite being able to make peace with Conte, Ciro is frozen out by Immacolata, a sentiment that is shared by Gennaro once he returns to Naples. Gennaro, becoming more detached and isolated, begins a cleanup of the clan's members, inviting more younger comrades, while engaging in actions that grow distrust amongst the old guard, including Ciro, who find Gennaro unable to handle the clan. A civil war then ensues between the two factions of the Savastano clan: the old guard who are faithful to Pietro and the younger members who are faithful to Gennaro.\r\nCiro, feeling ignored and devalued by Gennaro, aligns with the old guard, seeking to shift the internal equilibrium of the clan. Ciro also solicits support from Conte, managing to obtain Conte's respect during his trip to Spain. Ciro begins by killing Immacolata; however, Gennaro quickly discovers Ciro's betrayal and, no longer knowing whom to trust, enlists the members loyal to him in order to dismantle the old guard he believes to be Ciro's accomplices. Gennaro largely succeeds, killing everyone besides Ciro and Malammore, both of whom manage to go into hiding. Gennaro later discovers Ciro's whereabouts, sending the members loyal to him to kill him, but they are intercepted and brutally massacred by Conte's clan. Gennaro is later shot by Ciro, while Malammore breaks Pietro out of a police transport van during a prison transfer.\r\nSeason 2 (2016)\r\nFollowing his escape from prison, Pietro realizes that his stay in Naples will be short-lived, and promptly flees to Cologne, leaving the clan in the hands of Malammore and the rest of the members that aided his escape. He also plots to seek vengeance on the people who ambushed Gennaro, who survived his shooting. Ciro, meanwhile, forms an alliance with Conte, at the expense of his relationship with his wife, Debora.\r\nA year later, Gennaro is healed from his injuries and reunites with his father in Germany, where they align with the Avitabiles. After an arms deal goes awry, Pietro becomes wary of his power waning, and decides to return to Naples alone to resume control of the clan. Ciro and other members of Conte's clan encounter trouble with Conte, disliking his aims at creating a monopoly and gaining absolute power. They then devise a successful scheme to kill him. Pietro views this as the perfect opportunity to exact revenge, taking advantage of the disjointed clan by murdering several of them. Ciro learns of Pietro's return, and wishes to negotiate a settlement. Malammore's niece, Patrizia, informs Ciro that he will only be able to negotiate with Gennaro. Wary of a potential ambush, Ciro goes to Giuseppe, a mutual friend of his and Gennaro's, to act as guarantor during their negotiations. Gennaro eventually accepts the settlement conditions set by Ciro, which infuriates Pietro. Gennaro explains killing Ciro would have caused a war without any boundaries and expresses his wish to focus on business.\r\nPietro rejects the settlement, and continues to wage war, revealing to Patrizia that he wishes to defeat his son for undermining him. He is also suspicious of Patrizia's loyalties. After violently killing another member of the clan, he plants evidence to make it appear as though the murder was a result of in-house betrayal. In-fighting then becomes rife within the clan. However, after failing to subvert another member, Ciro learns of the true murderer and informs Gennaro. After Pietro murders Ciro's daughter, Ciro decides to murder Pietro. Disgusted by his father's actions, while also wishing to raise his son, named Pietro after his grandfather, in a world without in-fighting or violence, Gennaro agrees and informs Ciro of Pietro's whereabouts. Ciro murders Pietro at the Savastano family plot.\r\nSeason 3 (2017)\r\nGennaro assumes full control of all drug trade in Naples. He becomes feared and respected among the underworld. However, Ciro loses the will to continue, and after killing Malammore to avenge his daughter, moves to Sofia to work for Valentin, an associate. He later finds out Mladen (Valentin's son) tried to set him up, and since he's Valentin's successor, he hesitantly orders Ciro's death. Ciro however, murders Valentin and his son Mladen, and returns to Naples, while Giuseppe is in prison after Gennaro reveals his criminal past to the police.\r\nGiuseppe quickly avoids jail time by agreeing to a plea deal, and is placed on house arrest instead. He then orders the systematic destruction of Gennaro and his criminal empire, robbing and killing his lieutenants, which leaves him isolated in his war against Giuseppe. Gennaro then seeks assistance from Ciro and Annalisa, who are both eager to return to power. Ciro initially aims to locate allies outside Naples, however, he meets Enzo and Valerio, members of the Santo clan, who convince him only people from the city truly wish for Giuseppe's demise. Together, they help Gennaro resume business, while Gennaro also bribes lawmakers and police officials to aid his cause.\r\nHowever, Enzo begins to have reservations when many of his men begin to die at the hands of the Confederates, and wishes to leave. The Confederates, outraged, attempt to murder his sister by bombing the restaurant she works at, which begins a war between Enzo and Valerio, against them. Ciro desperately proposes an armistice, which is reluctantly accepted. Enzo's reservations are maintained, however, which forces Gennaro to kill his sister, which he then blames on Arenella (a member of the Confederates). This increases Enzo's involvement, and they successfully organize an ambush on Giuseppe and Arenella.\r\nFollowing this, Ciro pushes Gennaro to create peace with all their enemies. Peace is eventually accepted, and Gennaro divides the city and other land to the people who helped him win. Patrizia later kills Annalisa, which arouses Enzo's suspicions, as Patrizia vocally opposed murder during the war. He later stalks her, and learns Gennaro was involved in his sister's murder. Inviting both him and Ciro on his yacht under the pretense of celebration, Enzo reveals his intentions to kill Gennaro. Prior to shooting him, however, Ciro sacrifices himself in his place by admitting to murdering his sister, stating his desire to avoid another war, and wishing to re-join his family in heaven. Enzo then forces Gennaro to kill Ciro.\r\nSeason 4 (2019)\r\nGenny commemorates the death of his close friend Ciro Di Marzio together with Sangueblù. Then on a promise previously made to Azzurra, he decides to change his life but first, he tries to end a war that the Capaccio brothers have started against him. Due to the help of the Levante family, a powerful underworld clan of Villa Literno, he manages to end it before it begins. The head of the Levantes, Gerlando, is Genny's uncle (who is married to his mother Imma's cousin). At a meeting, Genny dictated the terms of peace in front of Patrizia, Enzo, Valerio, the Capaccio brothers and Gerlando with his three sons, Saro, Michelangelo and Francesco. Patrizia is given total control over Secondigliano. This one, in turn, supplies the squares with drugs, at agreed prices, without creating competition between the components of the Alliance. Genny then announces his retirement and changes his life.\r\nA year later he reinvented himself as an entrepreneur and aimed to build a second airport in Campania, all in a legal manner with the help of manager Alberto Resta, and his entrusted assistant Tiziana Palumbo. He buys lots of land and consortia for the realization of the project, even abroad, such as London. Nevertheless his past, from time to time, tends to resurface. Patrizia is fully the boss of Secondigliano, and she has a secret relationship with Michelangelo Levante, the second son of the family. The rest of Michelangelo's family, except his sister Grazia, are against the relationship. Gerlando then tells Patrizia, but the woman then reiterates her full willingness to remain at Michelangelo's side.\r\nThe boss of Secondigliano later has a big problem with a shipment of drugs seized by the police and undertakes, at a meeting with members of the Alliance, to pay the next shipment at her own expense, to make up for the financial losses of those who had paid the one seized. However, the Capaccios want to be repaid immediately to reinvest in a new channel and Patrizia borrows the money from Genny. The latter agrees but asks for the author of the complaint which then led to the seizure of her cargo. However, a good part of it is still on the streets thanks to an African criminal group. Patrizia's most trusted man, Nicola, investigates the matter with his cousin Lino. With the excuse of wanting to buy a batch of drugs from the Africans, Nicola tries to get to the bottom of the matter, and at the appointment to buy the goods, he finds out. The Levantes were behind the stolen shipment because they do not want Patrizia at the helm of Secondigliano. Saro and Francesco kill Lino, and force Nicola to kill Patrizia if she does not want to lose other family members. Michelangelo is informed through Grazia of their intent and restrains Nicola, who is about to kill Patrizia. She loads him into her car and takes him with her to the family vineyard for a clarification with her brothers, discovering that her father has ordered them to kill her. However Michelangelo cannot go against his family and kills Nicola with his own gun. Then he is informed by Patrizia that she is expecting a child by him.\r\nMeanwhile, Genny has problems with the bodies that emerge outside the building of the multi-storey car park of the airport, and he begins to have the judiciary on his tail. He has Alberto, his partner, killed when he learns from Tiziana of her interview with the prosecutor, for fear that she might reveal, sooner or later, his name behind the project. He accompanies Patrizia to the altar who marries Michelangelo, and as a gift he gives her the total dominion of Secondigliano. Finally, he promotes Tiziana as the new managing director for the airport, but he begins to regret the project.\r\nValerio tries in great secrecy to discover, together with 'a Golia, Cantonese and MMA who is behind the seizure of the cargo. To do this, he enters into a fake secret agreement with the Capaccios, of whom he suspects a lot about the affair. At a second meeting with them, he first delivers a letter to his father to be delivered to Enzo in case something unpleasant should happen to him, he knows the truth previously discovered by Nicola, and finds his treasonous death at the hands of 'a Golia, who accompanied him to the meeting. The latter then makes a real agreement, with the Capaccios and the Levantes to take out Sangueblù. Thanks to the unexpected visit of Valerio's father, Sangueblù reads the letter that he delivers to him and understands the reason for his friend's secret initiatives before dying. He then sets a trap for his enemies and the traitor 'a Goliath with a fake appointment for a new drug channel and kills 'a Goliath and 'o Crezi.\r\nA sudden police roundup lands Patrizia in custody. In a conversation with the magistrate Walter Ruggieri, she discovers that her husband is behind the loss of the shipment. Genny is informed by Fernando about the arrest of Patrizia and tries to get her a lawyer who can get her out immediately, to prevent the woman from talking about him, in front of Ruggieri. But Azzurra wants her dead, to avoid losing the investments made so far. Patrizia begins to talk about her enemies in front of Ruggieri, in a well-protected place, but the magistrate wants much more information: that of Genny Savastano. Sangueblù has changed his hiding place after the failed ambush at the Levantes'. However, 'o Diplomato finds Maria, Sangueblù's girlfriend, together with two other men whom he had left to guard her, and kills them. Genny ambushes the Levantes and kills Gerlando, his wife and their escort. He sends Fernando and another man to relieve Patrizia and Michelangelo from the hiding place of the prosecution. Genny commissions a plane to get them to leave Italy. At the airbase, he has a private talk with Patrizia. He asks her if she spoke about him in front of Ruggieri, during the deposition made in the prosecutor's office, but she denies it. Michelangelo, already waiting on the plane, is shot and killed. Genny then pulls a gun on her and kills her. Finally Genny goes to his bunker where his fugitive begins.\r\nSeason 5 (2021)\r\nA fugitive in a bunker in Ponticelli, under the strict protection of the ferocious boss Don Angelo, known as o' Maestrale, Genny evades the police on his tail and at the same time tries to recover Secondigliano from the hands of the surviving Levantes. During the war he discovers through the mouth of Don Aniello, an ally of the latter together with his nephew 'o Diplomato, that Ciro Di Marzio is still alive. He joins him in Riga after having killed them both and between the two it seems the beginning of a newfound relationship. Instead, a war will start after Genny reveals his feelings of abandonment and betrayal towards him, after the episode on the boat that led to his apparent death, with remorse on his conscience for having killed him. There is no point in Ciro denying it, nor even presenting Genny as the new broker in place of the deceased Don Aniello, during a business negotiation with a Russian trafficker. At the end of the evening, Genny locks up Ciro in a gulag and returns to Naples, taking back his neighborhood from the Levantes.\r\nCiro manages to escape by feigning death by hanging and returns to Secondigliano. Thus he starts a war that sees allies with him the most faithful 'o Pitbull and the old clan of Forcella, of which he had been the master to some extent. In the ensuing conflict, the Immortal emerges victorious and manages to expand his army due to Sangueblù and the support of Nunzia, widow of 'o Galantommo, killed on Genny's orders. Ciro then steals the Levantes' shipments which he needs to supply his squares. He finally receives the help of an unexpected ally, Luciana, wife of 'o Maestrale, after she smells defeat in Gennaro in the ongoing war. Ciro and Nunzia stipulate an agreement with her: one million euros in exchange for the names of the business partners who collaborate with their opponent. Then due to Azzurra, who had previously cleared her husband of murder charges before the magistrate Walter Ruggieri, as well as having escaped an attack by Nunzia's men, she discovers Luciana's scam and orders her husband to kill her. Genny entrusts this deed to 'o Maestrale, who hides her in secret instead. Ciro defeats him definitively after losing Ronni and Sangueblù in the battle, reduced to death after being tortured by Genny with punches, kicks and blows with iron bars. After Carmelo Lo Diacono appears before Ruggieri admitting to the ambush that he himself had failed against Azzurra and her son, little Pietro is taken to a family home due to his dangerous living conditions. Genny later kidnaps Simone, Ruggieri's son.\r\nThey go together to the Maccauro house where Ciro then forces 'o Munaciello to call Ruggieri, who in the meantime has discovered the location of the family home where little Pietro is being held and reports to him. Upon receiving the information, Ciro treacherously kills 'o Maestrale, and orders O'Munaciello to bring him Azzurra, and 'o Bellebuono to eliminate Luciana. In front of Azzurra, Ciro blackmails her into bringing him her husband for information about the location of the family home. Azzurra sends Genny into catalepsy with a powerful sleeping pill in a glass of wine and brings him to Ciro. Ciro and Genny meet again face to face after the last meeting they had in Latvia. In this new confrontation, Ciro proposes to fetch Pietro together with his father, on the condition that he declare surrender before their respective men. However, Nunzia arrives who wants her revenge as agreed with Ciro, and to guarantee that he will fulfill his promise, she takes Azzurra hostage. The Immortal apparently complies and, after having reunited Genny with his son, contacts Nunzia to join them on the beach, who, shortly before leaving, orders six of her men to go to the same beach. Even the magistrate Ruggieri is reunited with his son, while O'Munaciello is shot dead by Genny, accused by the latter of being a villain. During the journey, however, she is stopped by a fake police checkpoint where she is murdered together with the driver. Azzurra is taken by 'o Bellebuono to be brought to the beach where she can embrace her family again. Ciro has the opportunity to be able to eliminate the whole Savastano family, but taken by a sense of guilt for having lost his family in the past, during the conflict with Don Pietro, he has second thoughts while holding them at gunpoint, and takes them on a boat to safety. However, Genny stays with him after Nunzia's men break into the beach where a bloody shootout ensues by the sea. 'O Pitbull and 'o Bellebuono are killed. After killing many of the attackers together, Genny is killed by a remaining one. As Ciro sheds tears in front of his dead body, he too is shot in the head by a sniper by an unknown assailant.\r\nBroadcast and release\r\nThe show's first season premiered on Sky Atlantic and Sky Cinema 1 in Italy on 6 May 2014.

The first season holds a 95% rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews and with an average rating of 7.31/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Gomorrah brings a refreshing twist to a familiar story, with its realistic, unglamorous and often riveting portrayal of a Neapolitan crime organization\". On Metacritic, it has a rating of 76 out of 100, based on 15 reviews.\r\nBen Travers of IndieWire called it the \"darker, grown-up version of The Sopranos\" and stated, \"Despite its familiar construction, Gomorrah is significantly more frightening than others in its genre because of the history behind it.\" Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times wrote: \"Aggressively dark, focused to the point of claustrophobia and often all but choking on its own authenticity, Gomorrah shocks the system like a real Italian espresso after years of skinny vanilla lattes ... in Gomorrah, familiarity breeds relief rather than contempt.\" Brian Moylan of The Guardian stated, \"For those who like mafia shows and the sort of anti-hero dramas that have become the stock in trade of 'peak TV', this is another excellent entry.\" Sight & Sound called the series \"Italy's answer to Breaking Bad.\"\r\nHowever, the show has received criticism from several Italian politicians. Naples mayor Luigi de Magistris claimed that bouts of violent crimes skyrocket in the city whenever an episode of the series is aired. He also added that the series \"is likely to corrode the brains, souls, and hearts of hundreds of very young people.\" Anti-Mafia magistrate Giuseppe Borrelli has stated, \"The series fails to capture any aspect of today's Camorra\", the national anti-mafia prosecutor Federico Cafiero de Raho has stated, \"it humanizes gangsters\", while the state prosecutor in Catanzaro Nicola Gratteri has stated, \"It makes them seem likable, which is dangerous.\"\r\nSpin-off film\r\nA spin-off film titled The Immortal (L'immortale) was released in theaters on 5 December 2019. The film is both a prequel and a sequel to the events after the series' third season, and stars Marco D'Amore reprising his role as Ciro Di Marzio.",

commanded by the dreaded and respected Pietro Savastano. Looking to make his mark, Ciro Di Marzio is tasked to burn the house of the mother of Salvatore Conte, a rival drug lord. After completing the task without hesitation and slowly gaining the trust of Pietro, the elder Savastano later entrusts Ciro to ready his son Gennaro to become the future head of the clan.</p><p>Following a police check, Pietro is arrested and taken into custody; control of the clan unofficially passes into the hands of his wife, Immacolata, who deems Ciro and Gennaro unable to run the clan in Pietro's absence. Immacolata, who maintains a dislike for Ciro, orders him to travel to Spain in order to make-up with Conte and reunite the clans. She later tasks Gennaro to travel to Honduras, hoping his interactions with drug producers will fast-track his development into becoming head of the clan. Despite being able to make peace with Conte, Ciro is frozen out by Immacolata, a sentiment that is shared by Gennaro once he returns to Naples. Gennaro, becoming more detached and isolated, begins a cleanup of the clan's members, inviting more younger comrades, while engaging in actions that grow distrust amongst the old guard, including Ciro, who find Gennaro unable to handle the clan. A civil war then ensues between the two factions of the Savastano clan: the old guard who are faithful to Pietro and the younger members who are faithful to Gennaro.</p><p>Ciro, feeling ignored and devalued by Gennaro, aligns with the old guard, seeking to shift the internal equilibrium of the clan. Ciro also solicits support from Conte, managing to obtain Conte's respect during his trip to Spain. Ciro begins by killing Immacolata; however, Gennaro quickly discovers Ciro's betrayal and, no longer knowing whom to trust, enlists the members loyal to him in order to dismantle the old guard he believes to be Ciro's accomplices. Gennaro largely succeeds, killing everyone besides Ciro and Malammore, both of whom manage to go into hiding. Gennaro later discovers Ciro's whereabouts, sending the members loyal to him to kill him, but they are intercepted and brutally massacred by Conte's clan. Gennaro is later shot by Ciro, while Malammore breaks Pietro out of a police transport van during a prison transfer.</p><h4>Season 2 (2016)</h4><p>Following his escape from prison, Pietro realizes that his stay in Naples will be short-lived, and promptly flees to Cologne, leaving the clan in the hands of Malammore and the rest of the members that aided his escape. He also plots to seek vengeance on the people who ambushed Gennaro, who survived his shooting. Ciro, meanwhile, forms an alliance with Conte, at the expense of his relationship with his wife, Debora.</p><p>A year later, Gennaro is healed from his injuries and reunites with his father in Germany, where they align with the Avitabiles. After an arms deal goes awry, Pietro becomes wary of his power waning, and decides to return to Naples alone to resume control of the clan. Ciro and other members of Conte's clan encounter trouble with Conte, disliking his aims at creating a monopoly and gaining absolute power. They then devise a successful scheme to kill him. Pietro views this as the perfect opportunity to exact revenge, taking advantage of the disjointed clan by murdering several of them. Ciro learns of Pietro's return, and wishes to negotiate a settlement. Malammore's niece, Patrizia, informs Ciro that he will only be able to negotiate with Gennaro. Wary of a potential ambush, Ciro goes to Giuseppe, a mutual friend of his and Gennaro's, to act as guarantor during their negotiations. Gennaro eventually accepts the settlement conditions set by Ciro, which infuriates Pietro. Gennaro explains killing Ciro would have caused a war without any boundaries and expresses his wish to focus on business.</p><p>Pietro rejects the settlement, and continues to wage war, revealing to Patrizia that he wishes to defeat his son for undermining him. He is also suspicious of Patrizia's loyalties. After violently killing another member of the clan, he plants evidence to make it appear as though the murder was a result of in-house betrayal. In-fighting then becomes rife within the clan. However, after failing to subvert another member, Ciro learns of the true murderer and informs Gennaro. After Pietro murders Ciro's daughter, Ciro decides to murder Pietro. Disgusted by his father's actions, while also wishing to raise his son, named Pietro after his grandfather, in a world without in-fighting or violence, Gennaro agrees and informs Ciro of Pietro's whereabouts. Ciro murders Pietro at the Savastano family plot.</p><h4>Season 3 (2017)</h4><p>Gennaro assumes full control of all drug trade in Naples. He becomes feared and respected among the underworld. However, Ciro loses the will to continue, and after killing Malammore to avenge his daughter, moves to Sofia to work for Valentin, an associate. He later finds out Mladen (Valentin's son) tried to set him up, and since he's Valentin's successor, he hesitantly orders Ciro's death. Ciro however, murders Valentin and his son Mladen, and returns to Naples, while Giuseppe is in prison after Gennaro reveals his criminal past to the police.</p><p>Giuseppe quickly avoids jail time by agreeing to a plea deal, and is placed on house arrest instead. He then orders the systematic destruction of Gennaro and his criminal empire, robbing and killing his lieutenants, which leaves him isolated in his war against Giuseppe. Gennaro then seeks assistance from Ciro and Annalisa, who are both eager to return to power. Ciro initially aims to locate allies outside Naples, however, he meets Enzo and Valerio, members of the Santo clan, who convince him only people from the city truly wish for Giuseppe's demise. Together, they help Gennaro resume business, while Gennaro also bribes lawmakers and police officials to aid his cause.</p><p>However, Enzo begins to have reservations when many of his men begin to die at the hands of the Confederates, and wishes to leave. The Confederates, outraged, attempt to murder his sister by bombing the restaurant she works at, which begins a war between Enzo and Valerio, against them. Ciro desperately proposes an armistice, which is reluctantly accepted. Enzo's reservations are maintained, however, which forces Gennaro to kill his sister, which he then blames on Arenella (a member of the Confederates). This increases Enzo's involvement, and they successfully organize an ambush on Giuseppe and Arenella.</p><p>Following this, Ciro pushes Gennaro to create peace with all their enemies. Peace is eventually accepted, and Gennaro divides the city and other land to the people who helped him win. Patrizia later kills Annalisa, which arouses Enzo's suspicions, as Patrizia vocally opposed murder during the war. He later stalks her, and learns Gennaro was involved in his sister's murder. Inviting both him and Ciro on his yacht under the pretense of celebration, Enzo reveals his intentions to kill Gennaro. Prior to shooting him, however, Ciro sacrifices himself in his place by admitting to murdering his sister, stating his desire to avoid another war, and wishing to re-join his family in heaven. Enzo then forces Gennaro to kill Ciro.</p><h4>Season 4 (2019)</h4><p>Genny commemorates the death of his close friend Ciro Di Marzio together with Sangueblù. Then on a promise previously made to Azzurra, he decides to change his life but first, he tries to end a war that the Capaccio brothers have started against him. Due to the help of the Levante family, a powerful underworld clan of Villa Literno, he manages to end it before it begins. The head of the Levantes, Gerlando, is Genny's uncle (who is married to his mother Imma's cousin). At a meeting, Genny dictated the terms of peace in front of Patrizia, Enzo, Valerio, the Capaccio brothers and Gerlando with his three sons, Saro, Michelangelo and Francesco. Patrizia is given total control over Secondigliano. This one, in turn, supplies the squares with drugs, at agreed prices, without creating competition between the components of the Alliance. Genny then announces his retirement and changes his life.</p><p>A year later he reinvented himself as an entrepreneur and aimed to build a second airport in Campania, all in a legal manner with the help of manager Alberto Resta, and his entrusted assistant Tiziana Palumbo. He buys lots of land and consortia for the realization of the project, even abroad, such as London. Nevertheless his past, from time to time, tends to resurface. Patrizia is fully the boss of Secondigliano, and she has a secret relationship with Michelangelo Levante, the second son of the family. The rest of Michelangelo's family, except his sister Grazia, are against the relationship. Gerlando then tells Patrizia, but the woman then reiterates her full willingness to remain at Michelangelo's side.</p><p>The boss of Secondigliano later has a big problem with a shipment of drugs seized by the police and undertakes, at a meeting with members of the Alliance, to pay the next shipment at her own expense, to make up for the financial losses of those who had paid the one seized. However, the Capaccios want to be repaid immediately to reinvest in a new channel and Patrizia borrows the money from Genny. The latter agrees but asks for the author of the complaint which then led to the seizure of her cargo. However, a good part of it is still on the streets thanks to an African criminal group. Patrizia's most trusted man, Nicola, investigates the matter with his cousin Lino. With the excuse of wanting to buy a batch of drugs from the Africans, Nicola tries to get to the bottom of the matter, and at the appointment to buy the goods, he finds out. The Levantes were behind the stolen shipment because they do not want Patrizia at the helm of Secondigliano. Saro and Francesco kill Lino, and force Nicola to kill Patrizia if she does not want to lose other family members. Michelangelo is informed through Grazia of their intent and restrains Nicola, who is about to kill Patrizia. She loads him into her car and takes him with her to the family vineyard for a clarification with her brothers, discovering that her father has ordered them to kill her. However Michelangelo cannot go against his family and kills Nicola with his own gun. Then he is informed by Patrizia that she is expecting a child by him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Genny has problems with the bodies that emerge outside the building of the multi-storey car park of the airport, and he begins to have the judiciary on his tail. He has Alberto, his partner, killed when he learns from Tiziana of her interview with the prosecutor, for fear that she might reveal, sooner or later, his name behind the project. He accompanies Patrizia to the altar who marries Michelangelo, and as a gift he gives her the total dominion of Secondigliano. Finally, he promotes Tiziana as the new managing director for the airport, but he begins to regret the project.</p><p>Valerio tries in great secrecy to discover, together with 'a Golia, Cantonese and MMA who is behind the seizure of the cargo. To do this, he enters into a fake secret agreement with the Capaccios, of whom he suspects a lot about the affair. At a second meeting with them, he first delivers a letter to his father to be delivered to Enzo in case something unpleasant should happen to him, he knows the truth previously discovered by Nicola, and finds his treasonous death at the hands of 'a Golia, who accompanied him to the meeting. The latter then makes a real agreement, with the Capaccios and the Levantes to take out Sangueblù. Thanks to the unexpected visit of Valerio's father, Sangueblù reads the letter that he delivers to him and understands the reason for his friend's secret initiatives before dying. He then sets a trap for his enemies and the traitor 'a Goliath with a fake appointment for a new drug channel and kills 'a Goliath and 'o Crezi.</p><p>A sudden police roundup lands Patrizia in custody. In a conversation with the magistrate Walter Ruggieri, she discovers that her husband is behind the loss of the shipment. Genny is informed by Fernando about the arrest of Patrizia and tries to get her a lawyer who can get her out immediately, to prevent the woman from talking about him, in front of Ruggieri. But Azzurra wants her dead, to avoid losing the investments made so far. Patrizia begins to talk about her enemies in front of Ruggieri, in a well-protected place, but the magistrate wants much more information: that of Genny Savastano. Sangueblù has changed his hiding place after the failed ambush at the Levantes'. However, 'o Diplomato finds Maria, Sangueblù's girlfriend, together with two other men whom he had left to guard her, and kills them. Genny ambushes the Levantes and kills Gerlando, his wife and their escort. He sends Fernando and another man to relieve Patrizia and Michelangelo from the hiding place of the prosecution. Genny commissions a plane to get them to leave Italy. At the airbase, he has a private talk with Patrizia. He asks her if she spoke about him in front of Ruggieri, during the deposition made in the prosecutor's office, but she denies it. Michelangelo, already waiting on the plane, is shot and killed. Genny then pulls a gun on her and kills her. Finally Genny goes to his bunker where his fugitive begins.</p><h4>Season 5 (2021)</h4><p>A fugitive in a bunker in Ponticelli, under the strict protection of the ferocious boss Don Angelo, known as o' Maestrale, Genny evades the police on his tail and at the same time tries to recover Secondigliano from the hands of the surviving Levantes. During the war he discovers through the mouth of Don Aniello, an ally of the latter together with his nephew 'o Diplomato, that Ciro Di Marzio is still alive. He joins him in Riga after having killed them both and between the two it seems the beginning of a newfound relationship. Instead, a war will start after Genny reveals his feelings of abandonment and betrayal towards him, after the episode on the boat that led to his apparent death, with remorse on his conscience for having killed him. There is no point in Ciro denying it, nor even presenting Genny as the new broker in place of the deceased Don Aniello, during a business negotiation with a Russian trafficker. At the end of the evening, Genny locks up Ciro in a gulag and returns to Naples, taking back his neighborhood from the Levantes.</p><p>Ciro manages to escape by feigning death by hanging and returns to Secondigliano. Thus he starts a war that sees allies with him the most faithful 'o Pitbull and the old clan of Forcella, of which he had been the master to some extent. In the ensuing conflict, the Immortal emerges victorious and manages to expand his army due to Sangueblù and the support of Nunzia, widow of 'o Galantommo, killed on Genny's orders. Ciro then steals the Levantes' shipments which he needs to supply his squares. He finally receives the help of an unexpected ally, Luciana, wife of 'o Maestrale, after she smells defeat in Gennaro in the ongoing war. Ciro and Nunzia stipulate an agreement with her: one million euros in exchange for the names of the business partners who collaborate with their opponent. Then due to Azzurra, who had previously cleared her husband of murder charges before the magistrate Walter Ruggieri, as well as having escaped an attack by Nunzia's men, she discovers Luciana's scam and orders her husband to kill her. Genny entrusts this deed to 'o Maestrale, who hides her in secret instead. Ciro defeats him definitively after losing Ronni and Sangueblù in the battle, reduced to death after being tortured by Genny with punches, kicks and blows with iron bars. After Carmelo Lo Diacono appears before Ruggieri admitting to the ambush that he himself had failed against Azzurra and her son, little Pietro is taken to a family home due to his dangerous living conditions. Genny later kidnaps Simone, Ruggieri's son.</p><p>They go together to the Maccauro house where Ciro then forces 'o Munaciello to call Ruggieri, who in the meantime has discovered the location of the family home where little Pietro is being held and reports to him. Upon receiving the information, Ciro treacherously kills 'o Maestrale, and orders O'Munaciello to bring him Azzurra, and 'o Bellebuono to eliminate Luciana. In front of Azzurra, Ciro blackmails her into bringing him her husband for information about the location of the family home. Azzurra sends Genny into catalepsy with a powerful sleeping pill in a glass of wine and brings him to Ciro. Ciro and Genny meet again face to face after the last meeting they had in Latvia. In this new confrontation, Ciro proposes to fetch Pietro together with his father, on the condition that he declare surrender before their respective men. However, Nunzia arrives who wants her revenge as agreed with Ciro, and to guarantee that he will fulfill his promise, she takes Azzurra hostage. The Immortal apparently complies and, after having reunited Genny with his son, contacts Nunzia to join them on the beach, who, shortly before leaving, orders six of her men to go to the same beach. Even the magistrate Ruggieri is reunited with his son, while O'Munaciello is shot dead by Genny, accused by the latter of being a villain. During the journey, however, she is stopped by a fake police checkpoint where she is murdered together with the driver. Azzurra is taken by 'o Bellebuono to be brought to the beach where she can embrace her family again. Ciro has the opportunity to be able to eliminate the whole Savastano family, but taken by a sense of guilt for having lost his family in the past, during the conflict with Don Pietro, he has second thoughts while holding them at gunpoint, and takes them on a boat to safety. However, Genny stays with him after Nunzia's men break into the beach where a bloody shootout ensues by the sea. 'O Pitbull and 'o Bellebuono are killed. After killing many of the attackers together, Genny is killed by a remaining one. As Ciro sheds tears in front of his dead body, he too is shot in the head by a sniper by an unknown assailant.</p><br/><h3>Broadcast and release</h3><p>The show's first season premiered on Sky Atlantic and Sky Cinema 1 in Italy on 6 May 2014.

The first season holds a 95% rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews and with an average rating of 7.31/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Gomorrah brings a refreshing twist to a familiar story, with its realistic, unglamorous and often riveting portrayal of a Neapolitan crime organization\". On Metacritic, it has a rating of 76 out of 100, based on 15 reviews.</p><p>Ben Travers of IndieWire called it the \"darker, grown-up version of The Sopranos\" and stated, \"Despite its familiar construction, Gomorrah is significantly more frightening than others in its genre because of the history behind it.\" Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times wrote: \"Aggressively dark, focused to the point of claustrophobia and often all but choking on its own authenticity, Gomorrah shocks the system like a real Italian espresso after years of skinny vanilla lattes ... in Gomorrah, familiarity breeds relief rather than contempt.\" Brian Moylan of The Guardian stated, \"For those who like mafia shows and the sort of anti-hero dramas that have become the stock in trade of 'peak TV', this is another excellent entry.\" Sight & Sound called the series \"Italy's answer to Breaking Bad.\"</p><p>However, the show has received criticism from several Italian politicians. Naples mayor Luigi de Magistris claimed that bouts of violent crimes skyrocket in the city whenever an episode of the series is aired. He also added that the series \"is likely to corrode the brains, souls, and hearts of hundreds of very young people.\" Anti-Mafia magistrate Giuseppe Borrelli has stated, \"The series fails to capture any aspect of today's Camorra\", the national anti-mafia prosecutor Federico Cafiero de Raho has stated, \"it humanizes gangsters\", while the state prosecutor in Catanzaro Nicola Gratteri has stated, \"It makes them seem likable, which is dangerous.\"</p><br/><h3>Spin-off film</h3><p>A spin-off film titled The Immortal (L'immortale) was released in theaters on 5 December 2019. The film is both a prequel and a sequel to the events after the series' third season, and stars Marco D'Amore reprising his role as Ciro Di Marzio.</p><br/>"
