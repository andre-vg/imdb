It's not just the stars who make this show good either, the supporting cast are all just as funny as the main characters. In what starts as an imitation of The Office evolves into one of the funniest sitcoms in the history of television. It's about as perfect as a comedy can get. I dare you to find something wrong it! I still watch all the reruns when they're on, it's one of those classic sitcoms that you can watch as many times as you want and they're still just as funny after numerous viewings as they were after one."

The 1st season wasn't as good because the show was still trying to find itself so don't judge it by that, you could actually just skip the entire 1st season, but from then on every season is great. I promise you that you will not regret watching this hilarious show!"

      "content": "An absolutely brilliant US sitcom, far exceeding most of it's peers, with zaney humour and lovable characters. Shot in a similar vein to The Office, but with more adventures and less sitting around, across the series each character develops and evolves allowing the audience to get invested in each of their individual arcs.At times laugh-out-loud funny, jokes are split throughout the entire cast instead of having everything lay on a singular character. Although not all the characters are great, they do all play their part in the story and even when actors left the series, the incoming characters replacing them were even better and created better relationships within the world. The cycle and development really gives the show longevity, and failing that the absurd and infuriating public create instant levity.The long-term arc is broken up into smaller plots across seasons and episodes, but everything is interlinked and works out satisfyingly. A less cynical humour to The Office, but well balanced between characters such as Lesley and Ron, Andy and Ben, providing a better environment as a whole.Really easy to watch, always enjoyable, and one of the best US sitcoms rising above a sea of mediocrity."

      "content": "Quite appropriate that I should have completed P&R in 2022 on Netflix. I first started watching this circa Jan/Feb 2013 on Channel 5 (UK). I was unemployed at the time and feeling a little low, but P&R was one of a few beacons that lifted the 'fog' (albeit briefly).I think you either get sitcoms or you don't. I certainly do (although my wife doesn't), the well intentioned aims of Lesley, Ron, Ann, April, Gerry, Donna, Tom, Andy, Ben and Chris, but often with disastrous (and hilarious) execution makes for light hearted take on the whims and folly of local government. The subject of P&R is the apparent and overt lampooning of local government in the US, however, I do wonder if the writers weren't trying to make a veiled comment on the necessity of government in redistributing wealth and prosperity (sometimes necessity) via taxation. Yes, if you are looking for heavy duty drama or reportage this is not it. But the glorious endeavours of the crew never failed to bring me a smile. I loved this. Go and watch!"

The conclusion isWATCH IT!Ron Swanson is a legend, I also like pretty dark haired women and breakfast food (actually true).You'll fall in love, you'll get annoyed and you'll keep on watching!Btw April...

Everyone is helping everyone and Leslie is the glue that keeps them all together with her impeccable integrity and desire to always do the right thing. Even when she tries to do corrupt things, she is too wholesome to go through with it. Even though of her incredibly sweet nature she is still not one to just let people walk all over her. She's aggressive to fight for what she believes in while not compromising on her values to get there.We need more female role models like Leslie Knope instead of all this false angry pseudo feminism.She is by far my favorite sitcom character of all time."

It's about a smart capable main character who is a bit weird going against a bad system.The show is really good and it can be very funny but the change is jarring and I know people who only like post season three and people who only like preseason three, I think this is also reflected by some reviews.

You also have a few more 'normal' characters who aren't very fun on their own, but can create a humorous dynamic with regards to their reponses or interactions with the other characters.

It's a great staging area for mocking the Midwest (I like living here, but it's deserved), and even still, the producers seem to have an affinity for small-town American . . . so it all evens out in the end.But at its (oversized) heart, this is a show where everybody pulls together to fix a problem - and when that's centered on government, sentimentality or no, that's an angle we should all be able to get behind. It's just so damn optimistic, and that can-do attitude is personified by Amy Poehler. A more likable character (or actress) you'll be hard-pressed to come by.Also, Ron Swanson, who's probably the best sitcom character we've seen in decades.9/10"

It's similar to Arrested Development shooting wise. At first glance, it feels like a spin-off to \"The Office\" and it isn't until the premiere of the second season that the show starts to take shape with Poehler being the most lovable character on the show, Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) becomes everyone's mood and Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) well, you can't hate Chris Pratt. While other characters of the show never feel left out or just side-characters as everyone gets their chance to shine during the seven season run. In my opinion,this show has some great running gags and with a rocky start but a perfect ending this show was simply awesome."

      "content": "This is a clever sitcom, it isn't as funny as other comedy show, it doesn't have as much iconic moments but it is so much deeper in the exploration of relationships, you can think of any characters who interacted with each other and know what they think of each other.The story of each character is decent to great, there is no character with unfinished character arc. The actors are also great, everyone fits greatly their character and everyone is funny.Season 1: 7.5/10 Season 2: 8/10 Season 3: 8.5/10 Season 4: 8.5/10 Season 5: 8/10 Season 6: 8.5/10 Season 7: 9/10."
