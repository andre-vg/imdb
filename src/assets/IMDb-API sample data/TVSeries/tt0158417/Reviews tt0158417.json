This is a very demanding piece of work-- there are many characters, and many plots going on simultaneously. Stop watching for a few days and you might just forget what was going on. Nevertheless, this is an amazing piece of work, incredibly moving, and affecting like very few works before it. I can't overstate how incredibly emotional the experience of watching it from beginning to end was; the ending, in particular, is a extremely powerful.True, the scenes are a bit drawn out at times; personally, as director, I would have shaved off about 10-15 minutes from each episode. Obviously, the special effects are outdated as well, but they are sufficient to get the point across, which is the most important thing.Ideally, this series should be watched when you have 4-5 days dedicated to just watching it from beginning to end. Yeah, that's a big dedication, but it is also an incredibly rewarding experience."

      "content": "Mahabharat was a landmark in Indian TV industry. It did to TV in 80's what Kaun Banega Karodpati did in 2000. It carried on what was started by Ramayan - an epic saga series. Many Indians who gave no more importance to the epic, those had forgotten it, and most importantly the kids who would have had no chance of learning about it, were greatly helped by the TV version. Its greatest achievement was to revive the lost pride in the culture.Though the special features will now seem kiddish, the costume will seem gaudy, yet I appreciate the details that were achieved with such small budgets. Fast-paced episodes aptly covered the whole epic in just 94 episodes. I would recommend it to all Indian parents bringing up children in western countries to help kids learn about our great culture."

Every character has played his /her part so well that we can' imagine anyone else playing them now.... . Incidentally ,Mahabharata is the longest epic in the world 4 times longer than 'Odyssey'.It is supposed to have been written by Lord Ganesha and dictated by Ved Vyasa.Its historical proofs are scattered all over northern India."

It was amazing...the special effects may look old but the acting is superb...the acting done by the leading cast is unbelievable..this epic is about the meaning of life and Bhagavad Geeta spoken by Lord Krishna looks so real and understandable. Highly recommend this version..I know there are many versions but this is the best and the original. I think everyone in life should either read this great epic or watch it...it's not about Hinduism its about your Dharma (Duty) as human being. And if you are interested in great story telling you won't be disappointed."

      "content": "Mahabharat,the battle for Bharat,now the modernize India is the grandest and greatest epic serial i have seen in my whole life.The war that was fought for all the rightfully reasons.For some the greed,for some the revenge,for some the pride,for god just to show his divine power.This is the best we see from the Indian Television Cinema.B.R Chopra,what a proud man he would be after portraying us the grandest and biggest unforgettable epic ever to see.A startling insight of the life of God Shri Krishna,making of many legends like Bheem,Karana,Arjuna & Bhishma ,also one of the most ferocious and epic battles you will ever see.This battle was fought for various different reasons.A thousand reasons may be.All characters are just perfect.Bhima looks definitive Bhima,Karana looks remind us of how in that period Karan would have looked like.Casting of Krishna is perfect.It can't get better then this.You should just see Shikhandi and Duryodhan for the perfection matter.Fabulous.Casting hits the top in Mahabharata with Beautiful Draupadi taking most of the lime light.Fight scenes are gruesome.Lot of blood but truly in those ages war would have been fought like that only.Lot of divine and magical stuff.Some battle scenes are emphatic.Just try and remember the fight between Bhima and Jarasandh.Also,fight between Arjun & rest of the Hastinapur known as Virat Yudh.The fight scenes of Karna and Arjun are a sight to see.Bhishma too with Abhimanyu lives up to be the most emphatic battles you would see.And the breaking of the Chakarvyu by Abhimanyu was simply amazing.Death of Abhimanyu and the arrival of Ghatotkatch.I can remember every scene till the end.The 94 episodes get to you.But still every episode is unique in its own and portrays different attributes of India at that time.We are all fascinated by wars but this is grand,more than a war.Some scenes like Krishna taking the divine form and Bhishma vow are just astonishing.Krishna and Karna talks just seem endless.We cannot forget the Samay(meaning time) here who narrates this fascinating epic story to us.Nor can you forget the game of dice neither the Draupadi harassing scene.The soundtrack is surely divine.The voice of Mahendra Kapoor on the start of each episode just sets the mood to watch it even more.I am not sure if i will see a better Indian epic serial then this.This is Indian Cinema at its zenith.Even if God would see this serial he would surely bow and applaud the commendable work done by B.R Chopra.I can't stop applauding him anytime.The dialogs and all,they still echo in my ears.Starting from King Bharat to Krishna to Arjun to Bhishma to Shikhandi to Shakuni to Karana to Bheema to Duryodhan to Balram to Parshuram.I feel i have already touched the feet of God.That's only because of this.I can't stop watching this.Its just my moral now that does not allow.Geeta Saar still echo's in my ears.The beautiful visions of Shri Krishna truly comes in front of me every time.This is grand.This is magnanimous.This is class.If God could walk on earth ,surely it is due to this epic serial only.I cannot say more.I am lost for words."

      "title": "Full justice to the epic...",
      "content": "The T.V. Series Mahabharat produced by B.R.Chopra is the most popular t.v. series ever showcased on Indian idiot boxes. The extent of influence the series commanded on Indian population can be gaged from the fact that during the time of its broadcast streets would get empty, and it would be impossible to find a single living soul at the busiest of the town centers. People who were fortunate to own a television would play hosts to all the less fortunate neighboring families. Even passers by would get a place in ones living room.The series though technically lousy, and made with cheapest special effects, ended up doing full justice to the sentiments with which Ved Vyasa compiled the greatest of the epics. Its 93 episodes take you through every possible sentiment, every possible emotion, every possible relation that a human mind can fathom. People not familiar with Hinduism might find this series a perfect introduction to Hindu way of thinking, and its deep rooted beliefs and the social structure of the Hindu society.Series does full justice to the complicated intertwined stories and their sub plots. The story of Mahabharat is narrated by Time (\"Samay\") which was kind of nice concept and helped in rushing through the less important details. Baring a few, most actors did full justice to the characters they were portraying. The portion of \"Bhagwat Geeta\" (the divine song) was also performed with great gusto and in its true spirit. If you want to feel the true essence of Mahabharat, then this is certainly the right thing for you. However the technical aspects might disappoint you. Highly recommended to everybody. By far the greatest story ever told, nothing in this world can ever come close to it."

      "content": "A show like B.R. Chopra's Mahabharat cannot be recreated. This show was unique because unlike other mythological shows that time this show was shooted in outdoor locations. That's why war sequences of this show look so realistic. No one able to create war sequence like this show till date.The music of the show was great as well. \"Hey priyatame\" is most underrated among all songs. It perfectly reflects the mood and mindset of the warriors before the War.Mahabharat had ensemble cast. It seems like all actors were born to do this show. Each performance one better than another. IMO Mukesh Khanna as Bhishma, Gufi Paintal as Shakuni and Nitish Bharadwaj as Krishna are three best performances from the show. Nitish Bharadwaj's dialogue delivery is so natural. His eyes were so expressive and through them he conveyed so much. Other performers also did phenomenal job in their respective roles. Rupa Ganguly did brilliant job in Draupadi's disrobing scene. Arjun, Punit Issar and Pankaj Dheer were perfect in their respective roles.There are so many scenes were perfectly executed. Bhishm Pratigya, Draupadi's cheer haran, Abhimanyu vadh, Virat Yudh etc were some of my favorite scenes. Hats of to B.R. Chopra and Ravi Chopra for making this cult show and hopefully it will remain fresh for so many years."

It covers an immense amount of the original epic, as there are ninety-four 45 minute episodes. It educated me a lot on Hinduism.

His voice is like just strong and divine.Mukesh Khanna as Bheeshma is perhaps the strongest character in the series. He is exceptionally well. Nitish Bhardwaj as Krishna was an excellent choice, it was as if we were watching real Krishna on screen. Puneet Issar, Rupa Ganguly, Pankaj Dheer, Gajendra Chouhan, Paintal, and all the other characters were just brilliant.It will be almost impossible to write about how brilliantly each actors were in this series.With exteme conviction in story telling, this story stands tall among the greatest stories ever told in India."

First of all, adapting the legend of Mahabharatha is itself a monumental task since it is the greatest and the biggest epic ever written on earth. BR Chopra has done a magnificent job of adapting it onto the small screen. What clinches the score is the casting, dialogues, screenplay and direction.1. Casting - Everyone!!!!!!! No mistake in even a single character, be it even a small one. The best of all is Mukesh Khanna as Bhishma and Nitish Bharadwaj as Krishna. People used to literally call them as their characters even in their personal lives. 2. Dialogues - A single man, Dr.Rahi Masoom Raza. Despite being a Muslim from Ghazipur, UP, he was well-versed in Sanskrit. The dialogues were top-notch and incomparable to anything else. One of the main reasons for the popularity of the serial. 3. Screenplay and Direction - It is the magnum opus of BR Chopra. Each and every scene was perfectly created. Performances were terrific. Costumes, sets are truly reflective of Dwapara Yuga.I will not delve into the details of the plot since it will result in me over-running the prescribed limit of IMDb message space.Overall, this is a masterpiece of a TV serial and it will be a Herculean effort to remake. Several rumors float around like Muslim gullies used to be empty during 10-11 AM on Sundays, i.e., during the running time of the serial. Even shops used to be closed because shop-owners themselves used to watch it. I personally remember that every newspaper in South India used to print the dialogues in native languages beforehand for the convenience of the public to understand the Hindi language. I can confidently assert that there are not more than 5% of people who haven't watched this legend. And they are unluckiest of the Indian citizens!!!!!!"

Well, thanks to BR Chopra and Ravi Chopra that we got delivered the most close to authentic version of Mahabharata t ill date. Shows like the Star Plus Mahabharata, Suryaputra Karna and Karna Sangini can't even compare to this epic. The actors were great. I really liked Punnet Issar as Duryodhan, Pankaj Dheer as Karna and Gufi Paintal as Shakuni, Nitish Bharadwaj as Shri Krishna, Mukesh Khanna as Bhishma Pitamah and Firoz Khan as Arjuna. These 6 have alone lead the story and had done amazing acting. Others were also good. Although i didn't liked Rupa Ganguly as Draupadi (Pooja Sharma of Star Plus was better). Also, some characters were given very small time, such as Ashwatthama, Satyaki and Kritavarma. These were the most underrated characters, especially Ashwatthama. He killed many Pandavas, along with Anjanaparvan during fighting with Ghatotkacha. He also defeated Ghatotkacha, but that was not shown. But still it's acceptable. Also, i won't be taking about the VFX and technical ascepts, as technology and budget was not good at that time. So that deserves to be spared. Now let's talked about things i don't liked1) Although some things were unnecessarily added for TRP, the story was still close to 90% of the authentic source. Some mistakes includeDronacharya's rejection of Karna. The truth was that Karna was the disciple of both Dronacharya and ParahuramaDraupadi's rejection of KarnaKarrna repeatedly being called Suta Putra.Draupadi laughing at Duryodhana and saying Andhe ka putra Andha (The blind man's son is also blind)Abhimanyu's final death shown as killed by six warriors including Shakuni. But the fact is that there were 7 warriors and Shakuni was NOT one of them. These 7 warriors were Dronacharya, Kripacharya, Ashwatthama, Karna, Duryodhana, Dushasana and Dushasana's son.Karna not striking Arjuna on 16th evening because the sun had set.Karna's origins revealed on 17th evening itself and Duryodhana knows about his lineage.2) Sometimes some scenes were too exaggerated and over emotional that it become boring and hard to bearAfter than that i really enjoyed watching Mahabharata and knowing more about my Sanatana Dharma and my culture. Thank you Mr. BR chopra, Mr. Ravi Chopra and all the cast and crew of this show.Jai Shree Krishna"

The story of Krishna's birth, Bhishma's vow, the Great War it's all in here. Absolutely fantastic series, it is very inspiring to children and to adults. Whenever I see this, it encourages me to learn more about Hinduism and such a powerful series deserves equal praise.

      "content": "No one can do a better job then this seriously. You can cast these roles in their prime if they looked like these people and spoke their lanugague. You can cast Robert DeNiro Al Pachino Christen Bale Edward Norton Tom Hanks Leonardo Dicaprio Ben Kingsley Have the greatest producer The Directors- Steven Spielberg, Hitchkock, and Scorescese and this TV show will be a complet waste of time and boring crap compared to this TV show. The Mahabharata in its entirety was just perfect from every angle. The acting is better than The Godfather. The directing better than Phsyco. The drama, emotion, and complexity better than Schindler's List. The enthuisasm better than Star Wars. Forget the visuals and this TV show crushes the others and makes them feel like a childish, and immature movie. To make the Mahabharata is the toughest of all Steven Spielberg would die trying to make it and if you say he would then you are wrong considering the fact that SPielberg probably has never written 1.8 million words in his life. I do not need to explain how good this is based on this."

Back then they had so much respect for their elders and even when wars were fought the enemies were respected nowadays all of that has disappeared. This is my favourite TV series of all time and I'm Canadian born too but this just reminds me of how life should be especially karn. You'll never find a person like him in this world. For a series made 18 years ago, its an awesome series and if this did happen then i wish i was living back in that time not during the war but i mean in general with all the respect and honour. This is our history don't forget it."

      "title": "The best TV series of all times",
      "content": "Mahabharat directed by BR Chopra is unquestionably the best rendition of the Indian master epic by the same name. Shot in late 1980s, the show was the \"traffic stopper\" of that era. People stopped going outside of their homes when this used to be telecasted on TVs. The audition for this series was involved more than 25,000 people over a period of 2 years. Just imagine the magnanimous scale of this masterpiece. The special effects are really good considering that it was shot in 1980s and not the X-men era. What makes this stand out from all other versions of Mahabharat is the stellar acting by all the lead actors. Seems like they were born to play these roles. Top class direction, world class acting, and an equally engaging tale of the war between the good and evil with tremendous amount of learning for every person in this world. No episode Game of Thrones or Spartacus comes even near to this. THIS IS A MUST WATCH FOR PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS."
