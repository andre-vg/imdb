It was a memorable series for me. My favorite character white beard grandfather and Ismaıl. Dede is a fictional character from Turkish folk tales, and he appears in people's dreams to give them directions and foresight. Burak Aksak really successful a writer. You should definitely watch this series. I would say at least a look... 10/10"

I personally volunteer to write English subtitles for this wonderful most amazing TV show I have ever seen in decades.Coz this show has it all.. It's so cleverly written, acting is amazing and very well directed. It captures you and makes you wanna be a part of it just within a few episodes and you start feeling like these characters are your friends, their problems are your problems and their joys are yours as well. Each and every character has real dept and originality. It's also unique in a way that it can catch the young audiences' attention like no Turkish series could ever catch before. I'm thankful for all of the cast and crew for introducing this absurd comedy which is full of clever references, sarcasm and intelligence. Very well done. Two thumbs up, what the hell i'll just trow in a standing ovation as well. Keep up the good work."

The background is the Bosphorus and Istanbul.Mecnun is in her mid twenties , still trying to graduate from high school and Leyla is in university, living in a mansion.Arda is the ex boyfriend of Leyla, whose father is doing business with Leyla's father and Leyla's father is in huge depth. He tries to convince his daughter to marry to Arda.Because it is an absurd comedy, you can see Mecnun in space , sometimes Leyla on an island after a plane crash (Oceanic Airways :) ), sometimes a friend of them trying to survive 147 hours on a mountain :)... The series created a huge fan group and still groving ."

Ismail Abi is an orphan who was abandoned by his mother, raised by his father. He always wears colorful suits because his father told him his mum left them because they had not have a colorful life. This lonely, affectionate man is the most positive character. Erdal Bakkal is the anti-hero character in the series. He always makes contradictory comments on anything.

The audience is highly active in social media (especially eksisozluk.com users) try to find the references which are in given in a very high range. From Oz to House, Lost, Godfather, Eternal sunshine on a spotless mind, modern Turkish literature there are lots of references or 80's or 90's popular culture references. The show became very popular and \"cult\" in a short period of time.Series are not in the high ranks of rating lists however fans of the show support in every possible way to promote, Monday evening in twitter hashtag with the name of the show becomes trending topic. Director Onur Ünlü definitely has a distinguished taste and you can easily recognise his style and vision. Script writer Burak Aksak has a absurd comedy sense with dialogues in a situational comedy sense which is not something Turkish shows witness.Most of the actors have theater school background and the show gives them to develop their characters easily and gives more than enough room for improvisations. They perform utterly sensational and the audience feel they love the work the cast performing. Especially Ali Atay, Ahmet Mumtaz Taylan, Serkan Keskin, Osman Sonant, Koksal Engur and Cengiz Bozkurt's performances are top notch. Yet length of the show is too long which sometimes has negative effect over the tempo. Too much references sometimes could be tiring.Although a substantial portion of the show is aiming Turkish watchers there are very good parts which can be easily understood and laughed by a \"foreigner\". This is a \"must see\" show with high taste."

Ali Atay, Koksal Engur, Cengiz Bozkurt, Mumtaz Taylan, Osman Sonant, Serkan Keskin are great actors, and they plays in cinema and theaters too. However, it has some directing troubles.

So performances are generally good. Biggest disadvantage is that it has been quite peculiar to Turk culture. So to find Enlish subtitles is difficult. Even if you get, you may not realize the intelligent, sophisticated send-ups.

      "content": "Last year, I began to watch Leyla ile Mecnun. It's absurd comedy. This is a most interesting and exciting TV series. It mirrors Turkısh daily life and street culture. The TV series stars are Ali Atay, Melis Birkan, Ahmet Mümtaz Taylan, Serkan Keskin, Osman Sonant, Cengiz Bozkurt and Köksal Engür.It's the story of two darling Leyla and Mecnun. Erdal is grocer. İsmail Abi is unemployed. İsmail Abi wears brightly dressed. Yavuz is robber. Mecnun's father's name is İskender. İskender is all of father. Not really. Mecnun loves Leyla. Leyla and Mecnun isn't marry however they wants to marry. In my opinion Ismail Abi is the most of character in this TV series. This series all character is funny.This series has the most time we are laughing at while watching. The special effects are amazing. The best thing about the film plot. Overall is really enjoyable comedy.I advice you to watch. The tea drink at Erdal Bakkal."

In fact, it was the most watched TV Show in TRT until now."

      "title": "A Most Excellent Idea",
      "content": "This show came up with a very good and original idea which is adapting a love story of ancient times to modern day Istanbul. To understand the main concept, you must know the impossible love story of Leyla and Mecnun. Shortly, Mecnun loves Leyla in the first sight and so does she. But whatever Mecnun does in order to be with her, there are always obstacles that prevents them from getting married. In the end, Mecnun goes crazy(the word of mecnun means crazy) and starts living vacantly. He goes to a desert and lives there. And after sometime, when Leyla finds her in the desert, he wouldn't remember Leyla at all. An effective and emotionally intensive story of love evolves into an entertaining and funny situation in modern times. The other characters are really unique and well-designed characters and they make the show a non-stop comedy in each episode. Yet, you need to know Turkish and must be familiar with the Turkish culture and humour materials in order to understand the jokes."
