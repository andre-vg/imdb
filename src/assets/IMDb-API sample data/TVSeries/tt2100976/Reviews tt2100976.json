      "content": "I'm not usually one to fall for a simple laugh. But these four friends remind me so much of the guys I hang out with, I can't get enough. Off the wall, who can make who do the most zany public display of insanity. It cracks me up. These four guys, who really have been friends since grade school it turns out, challenge each other each week to see who is willing to do the most crazy embarrassing thing in public. Usually one of them has an earpiece while the other three friends are feeding them instructions. If the friend with the earpiece doesn't do what they tell him to, he loses that round. At the end of the show, whoever has the most losses, has to do something EXTREMELY embarrassing. I watched the 'best of' where they actually interviewed these guys and that's when I became a real fan, because it started out just the four of them doing this without a camera. Glad they started filming, because it's really funny."

      "content": "These four longtime friends are hysterical. They think up clever (usually) stunts and then challenge each other, mostly on the streets of New York, to execute those stunts. Each is rated by the other three as to whether or not his assignment is successfully completed. The one with the most losses by the end of the show then must undergo one last humiliating stunt, again cooked up by his three buddies. It's a 'Candid Camera' with a twist. The hits far outweigh the misses. Unlike most tv comedies, this one produces numerous belly laughs. I once saw them filming in Washington Square Park."

However, it's the stars of the show that get the humiliation rather than the unsuspecting victims a la \"Candid Camera\".So, if you want to watch a goofy, goodspirited half hour of belly laughs, check out \"Impractical Jokers\".

Murr is definitely my favorite; he has the most infectious smile I've ever seen..he's just adorable. All 4 of these guys are very talented and what I enjoy most is the fact that their reactions are so genuine and don't seem scripted and fake as so many other shows do. The looks on people's faces are positively priceless!! Sal's reactions are perfect and he seems like someone who is very well-mannered and doesn't want to say or do anything to offend anyone; particularly if it's a pretty girl he's trying to pull one over on. This is a show I will continue to watch as long as it's on the air and my family and friends are big fans of it as well. Keep up the good work guys!!"

I have never laughed as hard at something as I do watching this show.My friend actually had to leave my house after watching a couple of episodes of this show in a row because his abs were hurting him so hard. I would most certainly recommend this to anybody, my mom is pretty uptight when it comes to foul language in any form as well as dirty humour. Although this show is packed with it (dirty humour that is) she loves this show more then all of us.I can't imagine this show is on the cutting block, but if it is DON'T DO IT!I have been watching this show for 2 weeks now and have seen each episode twice, I can't stop getting people into it. All I can say is this show is a must watch!"

The premise is simple: 4 friends compete in hidden camera prank challenges. Whoever loses the most challenges in each episode must face a humiliation concocted by the other 3 guys. While I initially thought this idea would get old fast, seeing it in action had me in tears from laughing.The boys' chemistry is delightful, and their ability to improvise their way out of embarrassing situations is impressive. The boys never fail to deliver the goods, and the reactions of those around them are just as funny. Great show, can't wait to see more of it."

They actually had a meet and greet with their fans in New York City last year. The fans were waiting in lines the stretched out the doors to meet the guys. They shook everyone of their fans hands and took pictures with everyone that came out to meet them. A great show and great group of guys. I have recommended this show to all my friends.

Anyone with the most losses must participate in an embarassing, challenge whether they want to or not. I started watching this recently and it's humorously entertaining.

      "title": "Impractical Jokers: Undoubtedly the Best Show Currently on TruTV",
      "content": "I just started watching this show, and I'll share a little tidbit of how I began to watch Impractical Jokers. When I was watching TruTV, advertisements kept on coming up for this show, and I thought that it looked completely stupid and idiotic. So, one night, I turned it on to see how stupid it was and low and behold, I actually began to like it. I hadn't even watched it for two minutes before I began to chuckle and it stayed that way for the duration of the show. Impractical Jokers is absolutely hilarious! What makes it even more funny is that it seems to be legitimate. With TruTV's programming, most, if not all, of it is fake. Shows like Operation Repo, Hardcore Pawn, Storage Hunters, Lizard Lick Towing, South Beach Tow, etc. all seem to be scripted. Impractical Jokers doesn't have that feel to it, as everything seems genuine -- the pranks, the laughs between the four guys, and everything else. That's what is perhaps the best thing about the show because it's on a channel that airs predominantly scripted shows. Many people seem to think that Impractical Jokers is a reality TV show, but that's definitely not the case. As I said earlier, I thought the show was idiotic at first, but then I began to watch more and more and I have now seen nearly every single episode of theirs.Another thing that is great about the show is that all four of the guys -- Joe, Murr, Q and Sal -- are very likable. Joe is the guy that never appears to be scared -- on certain pranks that have the three others tell Joe what to say, Joe says it nearly every single time, no matter how embarrassing, awkward, mean or crude it is. Sal, who is perhaps my favorite on the show, seems to be a very genuine guy who doesn't want to make anyone mad and most of the time, loses when the three tell him what to say. Murray, or \"Murr\" for short, is the part of the group that everyone jokes with -- i.e. calling him names, making fun of his looks, getting him to the more embarrassing things, etc. If it weren't for Murr, this show would be a lot less funny. Q... I really don't know about him (haha). He rarely loses and like Joe, is rarely scared.DEFINITELY check out this show if you haven't already. Impractical Jokers isn't a show like Jackass, as they primarily had very crude stuff on their show. IJ has primarily fun pranks that is sure to get the people around them to laugh hysterically. It's definitely a barrel of laughs and shows a great amount of camaraderie between the four pranksters.I would love to see Impractical Jokers come out on DVD in the future because there's no question that I would buy the first season or two as soon as it hits the shelves. There's also no doubt in my mind that this is unquestionably the best show on TruTV's network right now. When perusing through the user reviews, completely disregard the negative comments toward this show -- I was once one of those guys, but I'm definitely not like that now. This show is hilarious, check it out!Be sure to look out for new episodes of Impractical Jokers -- they come on Thursday night. You won't regret it!"

It isn't like anything I've ever seen because although it has some \"Jackass\" aspects to it and some reality TV aspects to it, it is an entirely different show that never gets old. It's what you wish you could be doing with you're buddies rather than going to work, just messing with ordinary people and seeing how far you can take a joke with someone who doesn't know what is going on. It's hilarious and it only takes 15 minutes to get hooked for life. I turned on reruns of this show one day in a fraternity house and within 30 minutes the entire 30 person house was watching and laughing, that is how good this is, everybody who gives it a chance will love it, I guarantee it."

Murr is my favorite but they are all fabulous and hilarious and keep my laughing for the entire show. I love the punishment that the losers get at the end. The funniest so far was when Q had to read a children's book about a dung beetle to a bunch of children and their parents. Lord I laughed so hard I cried. There was also another where Sal I believe had to use the bathroom in a coffee chop and open the door while sitting on the toilet to ask patrons for tissue because there was no toilet paper. LOL!!!!!! I love the interaction between the guys and I love that they are regular Joe's . There are like 10 episodes scheduled to play in 2 days and I have my DVR set. Can't wait"

Nevertheless, you soon begin to get to know the guys better and that makes it easier to emphasize and makes the embarrassment of some of the challenges even more real. There are not too many shows that I find really funny but I laughed like hell here for several hours, and that alone is something very precious. Sometimes the humor can cross borders and I don't support every gag that is presented, but all in all you get the impression that the show is not meant to harm anyone.All in all I like how people around get confused by what the jokers do and it is stunning to see how much people do just to please and get out of situations. A hilarious show that I'm always looking forward to."

      "content": "I LOVE IT!!! This show, as mentioned above, is one of the only reality TV shows that is actually worth watching. I watch it with my brother all the time. Joe Gatto, known as Joe, Sal Vulcano, known as Sal, James Murray, known as Murr, and Brian Quinn, known as Q, make one of the funniest and creative comedy troupe I have ever seen. The real gist of the show is that you have to do and say what you are told, mostly, and sometimes other stuff, like trying to get people to do stupid things. It's one of these shows that you really don't care if someone loses, but if someone wins, hooray! Who cares if you might have done the stunts if you were two years old? It's even more funny if you are 35 years old and married. Well, some of them are. Anyway, the boys never fail to be hilarious, and them getting along through their lifetime of friendship makes the show even more enjoyable. Trust me, some of these stunts are making you be happy you weren't on the show. At the beginning of the show, it comes out with a warning that says \"Warning, this show contains scenes of graphic stupidity among four lifelong friends who compete to embarrass each other. Viewer Discretion is advised.\" Making you think it's going to be graphic, but it isn't really. Even my dad laughs at it when I make him watch it, telling you it's hilarious. I laugh through all half hour, which is how long the show is. One of the only things I don't like about the show is that sometimes they curse, not a lot, but when they do, it's in a chain. It doesn't take away from the show, though. The scenes where they have to go up to random people and invade their privacy, are just downright hilarious. I hope this show isn't scripted, because that would really take away from the hilarity of the show. I can rave forever on this show, but, I think I summed it up well enough. This is also really short compared to my other reviews. See ya!"

Many times we just have the show on while doing other things around the house.At the same time we can't escape the fact that the show is nowhere near the same without Joe. Joe's absence hurt the show. The guest comedians are not working. Unless they find a better solution, this will be canceled. Let's face it, there isn't a better solution then convincing Joe to return.We all know Joe's public statement as to why he left. I don't buy it. I believe there was another reason. Maybe a conflict with his friends, the show, or maybe money. It definitely wasn't because he got divorced and to spend more time with family. The guy is now traveling more doing stand-up, comic shows and other events. He's traveling more than he did on the show. At least IJ was for the most part near home. It doesn't add up. My guess is a contract and/or money disagreement.Btw, for the anti-Americans and those that aren't American it's an American show, with Americans, in America. Speaking for Americans, go pound sand."

      "content": "I came into IMDb actually not sure what this would get. I was thinking a 5.9 or 6.3 but it was an amazing 8.7/10! 4 friends from college now in their mid life's have created a show that is funny, original, clever and nerve racking. Another thing I love is that the things they do aren't anything to extreme and not life threatening or too silly. And people were very harsh saying it was a complete rip-off of Jackass (it's nothing like it FYI), and also saying things like they force their laughs. It adds to the atmosphere of the show and what people have to remember is that these guys have been friends for 20+ years and are making a fool of themselves in public. If one of my closest friends started dancing around in public I would laugh my bum off. Overall I think anyone who likes a good laugh and has a good taste at comedy then I 100% recommend this to you."

The four guys are incredibly likable and you can tell they are good friends. Well worth a watch and enjoyable in bulk sittings.The challenges/forfeits are sometimes a little tame for losing, but still usually good.I don't know why, Merr has a really punchable face, but you end up liking him despite this"

As a former sociology major, I find this to be an amazingly insightful show that demonstrates some of the most fascinating features of human behavior and and responses to abnormal/uncomfortable situations. Absolutely hysterical!"
