      "question": "Why does the trailer park look different from season to season?",
      "answer": "Because the show's crew had to relocate to various trailer parks across the Halifax area, as production of the show consistently led to various complaints from residents and the crew were no longer welcome to continue shooting at said locations. This was a problem until Season 5, when a custom trailer park was built and was used for several seasons and specials until the show was put on hiatus after . After the show resumed in 2014, a trailer park in Truro, Nova Scotia was used as the new primary filming location. Edit"
