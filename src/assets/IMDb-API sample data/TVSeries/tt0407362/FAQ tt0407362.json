      "question": "What are \"Cylons\"?",
      "answer": "Cylons are robots created by mankind as servants and laborers. Eventually, the Cylons became self-aware, then they rebelled and declared war on their human masters. They later evolved and took on a form virtually indistinguishable from that of humans, making it almost impossible to tell a Cylon from a human being. However, only 12 different models of these humanoid Cylons exist, though there are many copies of each model. Additionally, when a humanoid Cylon dies, their consciousness is downloaded into a new identical body, making them effectively immortal."
