      "content": "This is just a masterpiece, the last episode is beautiful and Lelouch being a very anti hero comes of as one of the most heroic characters in any story.The message of anti war is very profound and brilliant, the display of politics, shadow play,war reaches Battlestar Galatica level.But what really makes this is the ending totally magnificent. If Battlestar Galatica fails on the ending then this will be better then that show in its portraying politics,revolutions,sacrifice,suffering,redemption,war etc.Voice acting in Japanese is just sublime and animation perfect.This show should be watched by anyone for it isn't a bloody good anime its a brilliant and masterful show that just happens to be in 2D, which is why I am recommending it to all my friends and my family its just outstanding and breathtaking.MASTERPIECE 100/10"

      "title": "Excels in all areas",
      "content": "Code Geass is set in an alternate universe, after Japan's conquest by the Holy Britannian Empire, with their powerful new robot weapons, the Knightmare Frames, stripping Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renaming the country Area 11. Lelouch is a Britannian prince who gave up his right to the throne after his mother was murdered, and has vowed to destroy his father, the Emperor, and Britannia. He gains the ability through the mysterious power of the Geass, granted by the mysterious girl C.C., becoming the leader of the resistance movement 'The Black Knights' to fulfill his two wishes: to seek revenge for his mother and to construct a world in which his beloved sister Nunnally can live happily.But beware, this is only a short outline of what the two seasons of Code Geass are about. Is this really one of the best anime series ever made (if not the best)? I certainly do believe so, because it does excel in all areas. It is a character driven series first and foremost, and here it makes no mistakes. There are absolutely NO STEREOTYPES to be found in Code Geass. All characters are as real as it gets. This is were most anime series fail, but character development is this series best feature. Apart from the two protagonists, we basically have more than 15 characters than can be considered main. As I have said before they are all full fledged and round personalities and even the gigantic supporting cast only consists of fully fleshed out characters. But make no mistake; Code Geass is a story of war and therefore great tragedy and drama. As it is in war, there is no real good or evil, and all the characters have their own motivation for what they do. Betrayal and changing sides, lies and deception can be found around every corner, along with incredible plot twists and character development. But how can the viewer keep track of these developments on such an epic scale? Easy. Code Geass is set in a realistic environment and a believable world is created (despite Geass and mecha action). All the characters decisions can be reconstructed and their motivation is understandable. Be it love, betrayal, pure insanity or maybe all of them.However, the anime does not offer any sense of right and wrong, good or evil and the characters even deceive themselves at times. There is no ultimate hero to be loved and no real villain to be hated. Everyone is right and wrong, good and bad at the same time when it comes to revolution and warfare; and everyone who is not shamelessly used by others, follows his/her own egoistical agenda. Sides change often so quickly, especially in season two, that you never can decide who to root for. This may seem like a negative point of the series, but that is actually why the story and therefore the entire anime succeeds. Because it never strays and cops out, uses the deus ex machina device or lets characters decide things they wouldn't, just to make them likable. They have to make decisions and accept the result and keep on living. As they say, ''sometimes you have to choose the lesser of two evils'', but since you know all characters so well and what drives them, you still feel with them, but hate and curse them at the same time for their foolishness and weakness. The animation is excellent and the mecha action top notch. It is the first time they actually bothered to make the machines as realistic as possible. Sometimes the animation seems very clean and cold, suitable for the world it creates though. Everyone seeking an emotional roller-coaster ride get on, you won't regret it. Code Geass is as epic as it gets."

      "title": "\"Amazing\" doesn't even scratch the surface",
      "content": "After watching the first season of Code Geass I was truly hooked. Not only was the series the embodiment of brilliant anime, but i also had a HUGE plot twist in the 4th to last episode and the ending only left you wanting for more since it left a lot of loose ends. Of course I had to see the second season, Code Geass R2, and it rocked my world. From the first episode of R2 you would think that it is just a rehash of R1 that doesn't do much original, but by the time that you reach episode 3 or 4, your jaw will have hit the floor and you will be in awe of this series' splendor. A lot of the similarities to series' like Death Note drop out completely in the second season and whole series takes on a grander, more political feel to the storyline. This most definitely is not a bad thing since this leads to the most complex, huge, and epic story in all of TV history. The creators of Code Geass stuck with the philosophy of \"Try to put as much content/character development/action/story into each episode as possible\" which gives the series a very swift feel that never drags along. This also makes is all the more shocking when an episode slows down for a couple minutes in order to accentuate a particularly important or tragic scene. Just like in R1, the cast of characters is absolutely enormous and by the time the final credits roll, a whopping 43 characters that you knew, connected with, and in-depthly learned about will be dead on the floor. And mind you, these are only the dead one, with another 50+ major characters that survive and that you also meet in great detail. In short, to support the great story, there is a mind-numbingly gigantic cast of fleshed-out, human, realistic characters. Everything else in Code Geass will simply appear to be like R1, just twice as amazing. The animation is tighter, the knightmares more deadly, the action more intense, and even the musical score is even better than the already amazing R1 soundtrack. Even the moral dilemmas the characters face are more powerful and by the end you will very much question the significance of war and how the evolution of war can affect people's lives. Going along with this, every conflict will have major characters, often friends, facing off against each other; a very intriguing twist that will have you not sure who really is the true antagonist in the end.It can not be put more clearly than this: If you haven't seen Code Geass, the first season, watch it now and then come back to R2. If you have seen the first season, this might be the most important anime for you to watch. Truly a masterpiece."

      "content": "Code Geass is brilliant. Period. It is one of the best animes ever made to date and stands with the best shows/movies of all time as well. You might very well have heard similar praises for this show before and I'm here to say that it deserves every single one of them. I don't give out 10 stars often, but I would gladly give the double of that for Code Geass. It has every single element required to be amazing. First off, it has and interesting and fairly unique setting. It is in an alternate future where the Holy Britannian Empire has taken over a third of the world, including Japan, which is the stage for this epic. On top of this interesting setting is an even more interesting premise. It may feel reminiscent to Death Note since it also features a High Schooler who receives a manipulative super power from an otherworldly being. Still, it does not feel similar to Death Note in its plot development and keeps complicating things every time the story feels like it's slowing down. Gladly, the story very rarely, if ever, do slow down due to the raw amount of events that happen in Code Geass. While some shows try to stretch out scenes as long as they can in order to make them fill up a 20-minute time span, Code Geass feels as though every episode is packed to the brim with events, character introductions, character deaths, and other amazing sights. Helping this along is a mind-boggling cast of at least 50 named characters who have lines. When I re-watched the series one time, I counted up only the names of characters with personalities, lines, and a life that you felt involved with that died. There were over 30. This will led to some truly spectacular scenes when huge mecha battles will break out with many protagonists on both sides. Speaking of mecha battles, the mechas in Code Geass, or \"Knightmares\" as they are called, are spectacular in action and feel very action-packed and full of energy. But as good as the action in Code Geass is, the part that you will really grab your interest and keep you fascinated until the end is the way that the characters and their personalities ties into this grand story. You will soon find that every single conflict or battle will have protagonists of both sides clashing with each other. I many cases, characters like the main characters Lelouche appear as both a protagonist and an antagonist which leads to you truly thinking about what is actually good or evil. These conflict, both internal and external will lead to some of the more intense scenes that have ever graced the silver screen. All this is helped along by solid animation and what might be that best soundtrack for any piece of cinema ever made. There is a truly gargantuan amount of musical content here that will any fan of soundtracks truly satisfied. Never has there been an anime that blended, brilliant character development, amazing music, intriguing moral dilemmas, immersive story, and exciting mecha battles as well as Code Geass has. The number one biggest must-watch anime series of all time."

      "content": "Without knowing anything about Code Geass before watching, I did not know what I had gotten myself into. Right from the start it grabbed my attention, evoking questions in a compelling way. I will not outline the plot as I believe other reviews do a very good job of that, but I will describe personal thoughts for someone who wants to know what they are in for if they decide to watch. The series has a way on ending each episode on a \"what's going to happen next?\" way but making you watch episode after episode, back to back. I have watched the two seasons at least 4 times over (no exaggeration).It most certainly earns it's place with the \"must see\" list. The plot development is excellent, carrying forward characters who represent certain ideals within the well thought out story. It is one of the few animes I have seen which really does have you guessing left and right, but more often or not, you turn out to be wrong. With an inclusion of a vast array of characters, it contributes to what seems to be an ever growing story. Even though I have watched it over 4 times, I still have the ability to just sit and watch with full enjoyment. To say that Code Geass has a re-watchable factor is an understatement, but what seems to add to that is the time scale at which it all takes place,it feels like a quite long and progressive trip, making you feel as if you have just been on an epic journey with the protagonist. From start to finish it had my full attention. I really do not have any complaints about Geass, aside from the fact that I was left wanting the third series to be released already.On a final note, everyone that I know that has seen this anime, being an avid watcher or not, has been converted by the likable plot and character development right from the get go, which can tell you something about the power of Geass. 10/10 (wishing it could be 11/10)"

      "content": "Before this, Cowboy bebop has the most artistic take on directing anime series, it showcased how each individual 20 minute episode can have the same artistic direction of a feature movie. And now came Code Geass.Code Geass tells the story of murder and deception (like the starting point of any recent Korean historical soap opera), but influenced by many well-known anime titles like Death Note (Teenage genius obtain manipulative supernatural ability), Akira (beautiful friendship torn apart), a little Evangelion (psychotic kid and \"HA-SHIN!!!\"), Ghost in the Shell: SAC ( Cecile's uniform and hair style-color looks suspiciously like the Major's). By the first starting sequence you won't find anything so special that created the mass fan-boys out there, but at the end of the episode (cliffhanger) you'll be convinced that this is going to be serious. Code Geass deliver curiosity at the end of any episode and surprises at every episode, following a greatly constructed plot that is so daring, you might think it can crash and burn any time, not only that, it surpasses Cowboy Bebop in making each episode as artistic and moving like a Nolan MOVIE. Speaking of which, the political run of this anime is so fast paced, it reminded me of the first time I saw Nolan's \"The Prestige\" without subtitles, the sequences sometimes change in such untouched momentum that the viewing experience may get mind-numbing after a continuous five to six episode (it is either a bad side or a good side, your comment). The real stuff here is the issues of morality, the script and the whole idea was to showoff how the director can sustain countless amount of character relations and messages and not to kill someone quick, neither to drag an issue to tiresome lengths, nothing feels too cheesy to make the action sequence boring and the whole story lol-worthy.The animation is very clean or sometimes feel a little lack of detail, but it is made by the same production that gave us ALL of the Gundam series, Cowboy Bebop and Witch Hunter Robin, so never will you see any scene run short in frame rate. The characters are designed by CLAMP so you'll see big eyes, pretty girls and ridiculously tall schoolboys, but the production takes the thing serious and remove the cliché sweat drops and chibi faces, and add seriousness to the expressions, be it happy or sad, or even downright insane. This anime have mechas (he he he), and the fight sequences are fast and waste no precious time, even though the creators have made them more realistic (mechas runs on visible battery packs now, and they don't run like Gundams, they have legs for tilting and balancing or sometimes kicking in ways of the spectacular, leaving ground contact maneuverability for custom wheels, and they look cool nonetheless).The music, in short, makes the episode cool like Bebop but I faintly remember that it is not Yoko Kanno's.In all, I won't spoil anything, and I won't hype it up either, I'll let the experience alone impress you, but from my appreciation: ALL HAIL CODE GEASS !!!"

Their emperor's conquest has lead them to Japan, which they conquered easily due to their superior military technology (machines called Nightmares). Japan is renamed area 11, and it is here, 8 years after Britannia's invasion that the story begins. The protagonist is Lelouch Lamperouge, a high school student who is given a power called Geass, which he uses to wage war against the Britannian Empire.*Overall Impression*: This is an incredible undertaking in animated series. The continuous plotting and action provides excitement that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the writers never fail to deliver the thrilling climaxes that you would expect from the constant cliffhangers. Definitely worth watching.*The Pros* After finishing \"Death Note\" and loving it, I started looking for similar series, and this was one that was recommended all over the place. After watching 2 episodes, I became hooked and finished the series (including season 2 or r2) in 3 days. Fans of Death Note will enjoy Code Geass, although I must say it doesn't have the same dark mood as Death Note. This is an excellent series for anyone looking for suspenseful & exciting action & drama. The protagonist, Lelouch, is an excellent strategist and tactician, and his brilliant tactics as he battles the forces of Britannia, the world's largest empire, will keep you craving more. While the action of the series is largely centered around mecha (transformers style robots), I can assure you it isn't simply a nonstop explosive battle. Much of the focus is on plan & strategy execution, and drama that keeps the story rolling.The artwork is incredible.*The Cons* At times, characters & dialogue can become over-dramatic or oversimplified. Lelouch's sister, Nunnally, for example is almost so sweet that it makes you sick, and sometimes characters shout & gesture in excess of dramatic effect.My overall impression is at the top, and I absolutely recommend this series to anyone looking for an exciting ride."

Despite all the robot-suits and Star Wars villain-esque get-ups worn by the baddies in the show, we feel for the protagonists and their fight against the Brittanian Empire and want to see them triumph.Code Geass R2 is one of the finest animes to be made in the 21st Century, and by far one of the most thematically complex ones to become such an immensely popular cult-classic, if not more-so than that status I just gave it.Code Geass is the show that's turning non-anime fans into fans right now, and for good reason. It's something more than your typical anime romp; it's a new genre."

      "title": "The Gordian Knot of Anime",
      "content": "The second season of Kôdo giasu carries on the first season's intricate storyline in fine style. Lelouche has been neutralised by having his memories removed, but swiftly rediscovers his identity, and the power of the Geass. With the assistance of the already familiar characters, he sets out once again on his quest to destroy Britannia and create a gentle world for his sister, Nanaly.As Lelouche says several times in battle, strategy always prevails over real-time tactical decisions. With this in mind, some viewers may rightly find the story somewhat confusing: alliances change on the turn of a knife, betrayals are plentiful and the conflicting motivations of the characters, developed so skilfully in the first season, come rushing to the fore resulting in a mêlée of politics, stratagems and ideals.Moreover the dichotomy of good guys and bad guys, which we have unfortunately come to expect in TV and film, is wholly inapplicable to this season, as it was with season 1. In this sense, Kôdo giasu can be an uncomfortable ride: should you smile inside at the (tactically advantageous) deaths of several million people? You just can't seem to shake the gnawing feeling that the other side might be right. There's nothing bland here, and the audience is challenged to make up its own mind as to what is acceptable in the circumstances. Even with the final episode, revealing the truly benevolent motivations lying under Lelouche's mask of deceit, the viewer is not forced to accept that the ends justified the means.All this leads to the Gordian Knot: imagining the plot as a number of strings with clearly defined start and end points, there is a massive bundle of tangled yarn in the middle. For a director to lead his viewers along this thread and keeping them sane is no easy task. To undertake such a journey in a way which keeps the audience hungry for more at the end of each episode can be no less than the product of genius, extremely hard work or both. Combine this with stellar animation, fantastically rendered character designs, believable mecha and a matching soundtrack, and it is clear why this is in the upper echelons of anime.I doubt that this is for everyone, and its not easy going for a newcomer to anime or manga. But for those it suits, it's well worth 25 hours of my life."

      "content": "Undoubtedly the best anime series humans can ever produce. No words to describe its awesomeness. You like Mecha Action stuff, you have it. You like intellectual stuff, you have it. You like emotional stuff, you have it. Code Geass is like \"THE\" epic of all anime series ever released. The complex plot and story with mind boggling twists and turns is like a visual and mental treat. The animation is top notch and the character development is brilliant.I will not reveal anything about the story since it will destroy your precious experience. Every moment in the series(both r1 and r2) is worth your time. People generally compare it with Death Note but both the animes are at different levels. This anime is meant for intellectual people and if you think you are one , you should watch it immediately.Overall rating 10/10 without a doubt."

      "title": "Best Anime I've EVER seen.",
      "content": "I had heard of this and heard lots of good things about this before I had saw the first six episodes of this at Animethon 14 yesterday. Not many people have heard of/seen this show since it hasn't been released into North America yet, but if it ever does get a wide release- I recommend everybody checks it out.Filled with tons of action, blood, and witty humor, Code Geass takes place in 2017 Shinjuku, where Britannia has declared war. Lelouche Lamperounge is a Half-Japanese prince of Britannia. He is long believed to be dead. He has secretly lived, making plans for revenge against assassins sent by Royal relatives for killing his mother and crippling his sister. He is a military genius, but that dosen't help the fact that he's a powerless high school student and orphan. One day, he gets caught in a Terrorist Act's crossfire, tries to help a strange woman named CC. She grants him powers. Now, he has all it takes to be a powerful military leader and lead in the crusade against Britannia's attack.Code Geass is awesome- Action-packed, lots of blood (I.E. The mass suicide in the beginning, when everybody shoots themselves, blood LITERALLY rains out of the wound), funny as all hell, and amazing voice acting is to be found too.If you ever are able to get ahold of this classic rare gem of an Anime, go for it. It's awesome, and it's the best anime I've ever watched. I hope to watch more episodes some time. Totally recommended! Rated 14A for Violence, Gory Scenes, Coarse Language, and Non-Sexual Nudity. (Canada- Animethon 14 rating)"

      "content": "YES MY LORD..... YES YOUR HIGHNESS..... YES YOUR MAJESTY!!!And I finally finished Code Geass. As an anime, this is nothing sort of a masterpiece.Season 1 was a great introduction to the series. We got an introduction to the philosophy and background of Lelouch, and why he hated the world. There's also a buildup to the character of Suzaku Kururugi, and the dynamic between Lelouch and him was an interesting one. The plot was not too complicated, as I felt this was more of an introduction that set up the series. The action, although wasn't as focused as the plot, was still good and the designs for the mecha were cool. However, the best thing was seeing Lelouch performing feats and charging forward. The ending was a big cliffhanger, but I enjoyed it overall. 8.5/10Now season 2 is where all the pieces that were set up in season 1 came together. Due to other things, I didn't watch season 2 right after 1, but the introduction to season 2 got me right back on track.Plot-wise, there were LOTS of major players involved. However, none of them felt wasted, and almost all of the characters had a purpose in the overall scheme. Even though it might get confusing at times, I was hooked to the story and found none of the episodes boring.The dynamic between Lelouch and Suzaku became more intensifying, as each had to battle with their philosophy as well as setbacks in their paths. I loved their development, as well as the humanity that they had to cast aside for their own goals.There was almost like 2 endings to this series. The first one was in episode 20 or 21, and I felt a major homage to the last 2 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The emotional impact wasn't strong, but it became a major turning point to the end.The real ending was bittersweet, and i was incredibly satisfied with it. The endpoint for the main characters, especially Lelouch, made sense, and it made Lelouch one of the best protagonist that I have watched. The ending also showed major theme about the cost of war, peace, and freedom, including sacrificing one's humanity.On a side note, the ending of Attack on Titan really resembled this ending, but AOT is still a masterpiece in its own way.Overall, I adored the complex storyline, character developments, and the bittersweet ending. Truly a masterpiece. 10/10(Also almost got tricked thinking that the 2019 movie was a sequel to the anime. Felt like if it was it would ruin the beautiful ending of the anime.)"

      "content": "Plenty of people have already written what this anime is about, and many have sung it's praises, but I didn't feel like any of them were able to truly convey what this anime series really is. I have personally watched over 200 different anime titles, of all of those I have watched Code Geass from beginning to end 9 times now. I will watch it again when I find someone else who hasn't seen it. This anime is extremely character- centric, and all of them, are well thought out and given their own sense of worth in this series. As the story progresses you begin to empathize with them and are drawn into the story to an amazing degree. I watched this anime while it was being released in Japan, and was both frustrated and glad at the same time when the writers took an extra week or two to write or animate the show. The characters that are supposed to be \"genius\" level aren't just spewing overly complicated words and having others around them go \"oh wow that guys is just so smart\" that most movies and series' do to let you know a character is substantially more intelligent than everyone else. This series has more than just one genius level character, and all of them can and do make mistakes.I feel like I could go on forever with all of the good things to say about this series, but I guess it really comes down to two things.If you can empathize with a cartoon character and you are smart enough to follow the story line, which at times can be arduous, than you will absolutely love this series. I guarantee it."

      "content": "I have to say, Lelouch definately acts like Light from Death Note on this. I absouletely like him as a character because he is just darn clever and does have what it takes to get what he wants. The way hes able to control people and the way he is really a sneaky b*stard, makes you think the likes of some of our world leaders today! Yeah it really hasn't changed in this century, if you're reading this review in the next century folks then you would understand what we went through lol! While I don't think the anime is the best but Lelouch does have you on your toes with his evil mastermind plans and you could see also his soft side because of his sister who couldnt walk or see due to PTSD. It really was sad that both their mum died and having the sister witness it from her eyes, then suddenly become blind/unable to walk because of it. Lelouch really is a caring brother and thats what I like about him more to the extent as a character.Well done Johnny Yong Bosch for doing such a great performance as Lelouch!!!!!!"

      "content": "What got me into it: When I checked out the trailer of this chapter of Code Geass on the final volume of the previous Code Geass. I have to say after seeing what the next chapter is going to be like. I had to continue watching it.When I got it: When my Big Brother bought me the first volume of this chapter on my 27th Birthday,and I bought the others on my own. It was totally amazing,and I've really enjoyed it. And of course the storyline was different than the previous chapter.Difference: I have to say the difference between the 2 chapters that the first chapter has the first knight mare frames,and later in the next chapter the same knight mare frames,and new ones. And of course some of the characters in the first chapter,and some of them in the next chapter. And new characters in the next chapter.Characters: Favorite character in the show are:Lelouch aka Zero,Suzaku,Todoh,Dietard,Li Xing Ke of the Chinese federation.The voice cast: I have to say that Johnny Young Bosch has a great voice for playing Lelouch/Zero,and Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers) playing the voice of the Emperior. And also to the show introducing Spike Spencer as Rolo.So if you have seen the first chapter,then watch this chapter. It's the best,and you will love it."

      "title": "Less Intelligent Version of Death Note",
      "content": "*May container spoilers*Code Geass centers around Lelouche Lamperouge, a high school student that shows his prowess as a chess player, penchant for skipping class, and his obvious boredom with class. The setting of this anime has a great deal of potential. Japan has been taken over by a world superpower called Britannia and is ruled with an iron fist. Lelouche is thrown into a power struggle between Brittania and the order of the Black Knights, an organization that seeks to free Japan from Brittanian rule. He gains a supernatural power called Geass that makes him able to command pretty much anyone (there are exceptions) to do anything he wants them to do. Unfortunately for the viewer, the anime is very sloppy when it comes to writing and no matter how much they try to make the characters human they come across as one dimensional. Lelouch makes stupid mistakes at every turn and rarely uses Geass, a very powerful ability, to its full potential. The story is plagued by fan service as nearly every female has their tits hanging out at some point and many of them get naked for no reason. The tone of the story goes from being dark to goofy in seconds and tries to get us to connect to characters, but at the end of the day you don't connect with them at all. They are all cardboard cutouts that you either completely hate or are indifferent to. The action sequences are decent but they get boring and repetitive after awhile. The only reason you keep watching is you want to know whether Lelouch is going to win or lose and you hope that it will get better. It doesn't. It remains average at best and most of the episodes are forgettable."

      "title": "Greatly flawed but still good",
      "content": "I watched both seasons at once, over the last few days, so my review concerns the whole series. The animation and art style are brilliant. While some reviewers seem to mind the ridiculous breast sizes, revealing outfits and nude scenes, I think they lightened the mood and didn't feel out of place. The storyline is slightly lacking, with many episodes relying on a single formula: \"Lelouch creates an ingenious plan; all goes well, they almost win without effort; Suzaku shows up and everything falls apart\". While the major plot devices, twists and definitely the finale are great, a lot of the story lines in many episodes seem to be merely fillers. The biggest flaw of the show however, is character development. Especially in Season 2, so many people switch between sides, are conflicted about seemingly obvious choices or make decisions, that contradict what their previous behaviour would suggest. The most apparent example of this is Suzaku. He is created as the opposite of Lelouch, believing in ends never justifying the means and in following the rules in order to change an organisation from within. While I understand that it is not simple for the writers to create such a character, the resulting Suzoku is so over-the-top hypocritical and self-righteous it's painful to watch. It is hence very difficult to emphasise with him as a positive character.The comparison to Death Note is obvious, as many other reviews have shown. In my opinion, Code Geass pales in comparison to Death Note. The latter is deeper, darker and has a masterful story and characters that feel natural. While the action and art style is superior in Code Geass, everything else is better in Death Note.In conclusion, I still give this show 8/10 despite it's great flaws. It is beautiful, captivating and thoughtful. While not the best, it is still very good."

      "content": "Code Geass Lelouch pf the Rebellion is about a 17 year old boy named Lecouch who gets a mysteros power named Geass which is aalble to control the thoughts and opinians of anyone who looks into his eyes. With his new power, the exiled prince of britannia vows to take down the leader of britannia, where he aims to create a world of light and hope for his little sister. A world without war, discrimination and injustice. I watched the firsr episode of thisbshow a few yeara back and sisn't really like it at all. I wanted it to be darker. But the firsrt episode didn't hook me at all. So I ignored it. Until I started to see how much praise peopmw gave the show. I got the ending of the show spoiled. So I knew what the fate of a certain character. But Indisn't know how it lead uo to that, so I gave the show a watch and watched past episode 1 and OMG, thia show is AMAZING. It is like if Death Note and Fullmetal Alchmist had a baby together. It really feela alot like those two shows, but it's different enough and more original foe me to not care too much. Leloucb is possibly on of my favourite main characters in anime. He uses that intelligent brain of his, combined with the geaas and you have this really skilfully, tactical man. Even the other main charactera like Suzaku, Colin, C2 are all so AMAZING. The animation, for a 2006 anime still holds up today. I cannot belive this show came out when I was 9 years old. It still looks AMAZING. The soundtrack is very good. There was nothing I really hated about this show, but maybe in terms id my mixed feelings, I would say the voice acting. I am quite split on this because when the englisb dub voice acting is good, it is really REALLY good. But when it is bad, it is really REALLY cringe bad. I would say the voice acting of Lelouch's little sister is possibly one of the WORST acting I have heard. It makes me cringe every time she speaks, although her actinf gets a tad better. Also, the pacing of the show seems a little too fast at times. I mean, there are some BIG revelations and suprises that happen and you dom't even have time to soak in what has hapoenes because it just foes on to the next thing very quickly. It's ironic because I loved the Naruot series, but the pacing was sooook slow, it felr like the show disn't get anywhere. But with this show, the pacing was so fast and snappy, you can't seem to enjoy certajn things. So if the pacing waa inbetween slow and faat, this could have been a perfect show. But, thoae are just my mixed feelings of it, overwise, a suprisingly entertaining show, with great animatiom, sounstrack and a grwst plot with deep messages. I 100% recommend giving thia show a watch, especially on blu-ray. 😁👍🏾"

The good news is that the plot is good enough to keep you watching. For folks who like action anime and justice/revenge plots there is enough here to make you want to see how it ends. The characters, as generic as they are, are likable enough to want to see how their story ends. But that is really it. Here is the bad...The use of amnesia is too convenient and plain silly. The struggle between main characters has been done to death and back in shows like Gundam Seed, and Scryed not to mention movies and books. Their struggle here is definitely forced and the situations that pit them against each other is extremely weak. The politics is just laughable. I mean... bad leaders are common but the problem here is that the leaders are doorknobs. Its unrealistic that they maintained power long enough to have an empire. There is a reason why our dumb leaders today cannot accomplish anything meaningful... by definition of being dumb, they are unable to succeed for very long. Then you have blind faith characters, forced tragedies that are more unlikely than winning the lotto, ridiculous romance side plots, bad guys who are insane from power, etc etc.Overall, its above average but I it could have been better. I have a feeling that the author will likely get better over time so I look forward to seeing more work from them as they mature."
