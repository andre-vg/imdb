      "content": "Before I start writing the review I will tell you just one thing, just watch it Watch it First, I followed nearly 20 Turkish series, and none of them is able to compare to Ezel Why ? Simply because he preferred them, this show is better than a persona series. This series is the least that can be compared to it is Diet Death Note in terms of intelligence, manipulation and shocking twest at the end of each episode, amazing music and great drama, and most important of all, the depth of the story, in addition to romance, is the best in Turkish series, better than any romance at all, even if you are not a fan Romance, you can only honor this show . A brief summary of my words is that there are a few series that deserve real concluding and watching, including Ezel, so watch it quickly and do not care about anything else. Ahmed gorshy Review My rate for the first season is 9.0/10 My rate for season 2 is 9.7/10"

There is much more than a story in this series. There are individual stories of each character. Ramiz Uncle's story... Kenan Birkan's story... Eysan and Omar's story... This is the favorite part of the series. One of the important things of the series also preached. Ramiz Uncle's preachers... Nobody is not good also not bad. And flashback scenes. Flashback scenes sine qua. I congratulate series team. Artists selected very good. Kenan Imirzalioglu, Cansu Dere, Haluk Bilginer, Sarp Akkaya, Baris Falay and a lot of artists. This series has a different place for me. Tuncel Kurtiz a great actor. Rest in peace... 10/10"

However, Netflix has only first season.All the episodes of the original Turkish Ezel is 2 HOURS LONG with 72 episodes, 72x2=144 hours. Netflix took first 36 episodes, 36x2=72 hours, and cut them in half, 1 hour, and made you watch. You only watched first 36 episodes, 72 hours of 144 hours, of original Ezel. Write youtube: \"ezel english jane p 35\" something and start watching the 2nd season.In the second season Kenan Birkan, the enemy of Ramiz Dayi is shown finally, and they start fighting.As a Turkish citizen I also like Ezel very much. Ezel is one of my masterpiece listed series. I also suggest these those like mind games: \"The Mentalist\" \"Hunter x Hunter 2011\" \"Reverend Insanity\" \"Breaking Bad\" \"Death note\""

Amazing writing and amazing acting. You don't get a true ending to the story. I wish shows wouldn't leave you out there and you don't get to know what is going to happen, or if it ever does. This show is worth the watch and will leave you with a wow factor. I enjoyed it and will watch again later when I can't remember how the episodes go.

The whole story is a mystery, and it reveals truths really slowly, but there are always new problems, questions, that we have to wait for being answered, but we have not to worry about the explanations, they come at the right time, believe me. The whole \"movie\" is exciting, we never get bored, during watching it we are always in stress, but in the good way, and thanks god we never know what happens, it's just a new thing, what never let you down, well, maybe sometimes we find it little long, it has 71 episodes, and every episode lasts approx. 2 hours. Nevermind, It's still a fascinating experience, that I never regret, I'm happy, that I see TV Show history in a new perspective, thankfully for this great Series: Ezel."

It's Ezel.Great balanced Turkish tv series is what audience need. All Turkish director should look at this project (Ezel) and learn from it. Balance is important. Balance between action, drama, mystery etc. is important! That is what Ezel has. Balance. (i am starting to be boring with this balance, but that is what we need, really).By the way, i watched every episode of Ezel. I really enjoyed it and you will not regret watching the whole tv series."

No doubt this is one of the best TV series in Turkey for the moment. Unlike other love based drama series (aski mennu) or only action based ones (kurtlar vadisi), this has nice balance of everything in the story... Lots of main players... very good character analysis. yes story is little bit turning around with same people and Ezel never strong enough to take the revenge but in 2nd season things are changing... that's good. i like the soundtrack of the series... i like DAYI's talkings advices... second season flashbacks to Dayi's stories is very nice... like another movie in a movie... places are very nicely selected in Istanbul fun, love, action everything is there..well done!!"

      "title": "Brilliant - despite being (loosely) based on Le Comte de Monte Cristo...",
      "content": "Generally speaking, I hate films and television series based on Dumas pÃ¨re's marvellous \"Le Comte de Monte Cristo\" - not because I dislike the novel (it's one of my favourites) but because most of the screen adaptations of the book compare so unfavourably to the source material that one has one's doubts as to whether the scriptwriters actually ever read the book. Almost invariably, the story lines follow the same patterns, altering the aspects of the book that make it great, without being daring enough to create good original material.Ezel is different - it doesn't even try to follow the details of the novel (it takes in present day Turkey and Cyprus, not 19th century Paris, and the characters bear little resemblance to their prototypes), but it smartly captures those aspects of the narrative that made the book great to begin with, while coming up with plenty of worthwhile original plot twists on its own.So what makes the series so great? First, the non-linear narrative makes this serialized television at its best (interestingly, Dumas originally planned to begin Monte Cristo with the revenge story, and tell the background story through \"flashbacks\", which is the route the screenwriters take here).Second, both the casting and character development are fantastic. A major problem with most Monte Cristo adaptations is that the main character is either played either as being something of a hot-head or so self-pitying that the viewer wonders how he could possibly have the self-control and intelligence to conceive or carry out an elaborate plot of vengeance. Kenan Imirzalioglu's Ezel, however, avoids both those pitfalls. He's all cold, carefully controlled rage - but the viewer never forgets that somewhere deep down, Omer (his original identity) lives on. Cansu Dere, in a role that is the antithesis of her part in \"Sila\", is equally excellent as his morally compromised love interest. EyÅŸan is not precisely what one would call a nice person - but as played with tragic vulnerability by Dere, the viewer can believe that she wants to be a good person, if only she knew how, and one finds oneself rooting for her redemption. It's difficult to think of a more complex or stereotype-breaking character on television than EyÅŸan. The rest of the cast is also extremely well-suited to their parts, and the villains do not suffer from that ubiquitous disease suffered by most television villains - one-dimensionality. Baris Falay's delightfully over-the-top performance as Ali (I mean that in a good way) is nicely balanced out by Yigit Ã–zsener's creepily understated menace as Cengiz. Tuncel Kurtiz gives what may be the best performance of his long and distinguished career as Ezel's prison \"mentor\", while Sedef Avci is luminous as EyÅŸan's doomed younger sister. Third, there are the production values. The series is visually sleek, but substance is never sacrificed for style. The costume designers also seem to be having fun, dressing Imirzalioglu in slick high-end designer suits and Dere in the sort of outfits only models (or characters played by them) can carry off. Finally, the soundtrack is incredible - it compares favourably in terms of quality and originality with great film scores like that from \"The Godfather\", \"The Mission\", and \"Doctor Zhivago\", creating exactly the right emotional pitch of excitement and suspense. The series lives up to its hype."

I thought I was so betrayed in the end, and became an anti-fan of it.Now why did I mention about Lost in a comment supposed to be about the Turkish series Ezel? It is short and simple, in the end of the series, I was satisfied with the results, and it was clever and not much obvious as it was on Lost.I would recommend everyone this series who like mind games. It is not like a mind-game lookalike like the series Lost."

Ali (The Pliers) cracked me up both good, bad, happy and sad.As for Ezel, I have to say I adored him, not as Omer so much but as he matured into Ezel his tortured soul,torn between right and wrong. Ezel was like looking into the mirror of my soul a reflection of past. The music haunts me Ezel will stay with me forever, thank you Turkish TV. I cannot wait for series 2 on NetflixI have just finished series 2 on Youtube, thank you JanaP and other Translators, you put in a lot of very hard work.Was just as thrilled with season 2, as Dayi and Kenan background unfolded. Yes you really need intelligence to appreciate and follow Ezel. Agree with previous comments around that as well as the program staying with you it burrows in and stays with you. Yes the ending was very sad at the same time left open for each person to come to their own conclusion, Ali Abi was brilliant in series 2, truly sorry for his betrayal. Loved that he, Azad and baby Teflo had happy ending. Can was lucky to end up with them. Cengis....what can you say, I would have got rid of him long before. So glad Ezel and Ali let him go!loved the train scene, Ezel and Asyan together forever, I don't think it could have ended any other way. I cannot explain the effect Ezel has on you....it does change the way you think and live your life!! Perhaps as suggested by others it hits some people on a much deeper level.For those who watch TV for pure light entertainment alone Ezel may not be for you. It take deep concentration and understanding and hits you emotionally. Thank you for giving me the Ezel experience and taking me along the journey. Xx"

The film edition is amazing, absolutely extraordinary camera work, never ever saw angles and colors like that ones before. Poetry is essential part of the series, the speaking of the characters is crazy, and every episode is perfectly ensambled from beginning to end. I think this series can show the soul and the mind of human beings as if they are expressed in material terms. If you love reading and thinking this series is for you, you have to put all your attention and don't let go any detail. I just have to say I loved the script, the actors, the locations, the camera, the feelings this gave me, etc. It's addictive. I don't think there will be something like this again."

After betrayal his best friends and love of his life, Omer returns with a new face, new identity and with a flawless revenge plan. And a new name: Ezel.But story is not like what it seems. It has so many themes and back stories. Direction is quite different than other TV series. Narrative with flashbacks quite effective. Every episode is like a movie. Wonderfully written script is full of secrets and surprises. You just can't predict what is going to happen next.All the actors are magnificent. (But Cansu Dere is trying so hard. She is god awful actress.) Especially Kenan Imirzalioglu (which is the best actor of his generation) and Tuncel Kurtiz are awesome. Tuncel Kurtiz's character Ramiz Karaeski is a phenomenon. He is like a god and full of mysteries. You have to see it to believe it.I would strongly suggest that anyone who has not yet seen it give it a try. Definitely is the best TV series ever made in Turkey."

Otherwise it is not easy to understand what is going on in any episode.

Unnecessarily meaningless episodes (bulk up) must be edited out, if it is to win western taste. Ezel is a clear winner, even though its a bit Twin Peaks in the end. It is a \"must watch\""
