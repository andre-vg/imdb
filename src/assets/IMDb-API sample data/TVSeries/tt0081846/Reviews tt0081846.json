      "title": "a milestone in scientific educational fun and amusement: outstanding work of art",
      "content": "More than twenty years on, but this documentary series still stands out head and shoulders above most. It is not simply the fact that it was a well-made production, but more of how it was presented. Professor Carl Sagan offered ordinary intelligent viewers an enthralling scientific series without the scientific language; he presented it as if he were an excellent school-teacher, right there before the class, in his careful, methodical way of speaking. His carefully worded explanations of all that could be seen on screen added superbly to that something which is close to magical; thus, for many people, it was a magnificent series for people to learn English; and I include a lot of North Americans and British people!The magnificent use of visual concepts as Professor Sagan took us on his voyage into the unknown, was admirably backed up by a sensational selection of music which just lifted the entire work way above the run-of-the-mill documentaries. Here there is no preaching: just simple plain old-fashioned teaching; but so carefully carried out. The universe came to life as we journeyed on through the Cosmos: it was at once exciting, it was fun, it was spell-binding, but this series was always educational in the first degree. And do not think I am talking about it being for a classroom of 14 year-olds: this is not the case. Whatever your age, `Cosmos' is one of those great landmarks in the making of anything for the screen, whether the big one or the small one.Previous to this wonderful series, I had only heard Vangelis' music in `Chariots of Fire', but with the selection used in `Cosmos' I have become the firmest stalwart of this brilliant Greek musician and composer. Who can forget such delightful pieces as `Entends-tu les Chiens Aboyer' and - on my LP recording! - the Bulgarian Shepherdess Song, as well as the other pieces used to such effective advantage for this unrepeatable TV documentary series? This is a series that should be repeated again and again. Outstandingly brilliant.Many thanks to the late Professor Carl Sagan and to KCET, Los Angeles."

Amazingly, drew us in to his world, even those of us who felt that true Science was beyond their grasp. His love of the subject was always apparent, and although his knowledge was overwhelming, his presentation of it never was.I was in school when Cosmos was first broadcast...for me and for many people I know Cosmos was the first time the Universe came to life. I recommend it for anyone of virtually any age...Be enthralled by what's within and without...Also recommended: The Connections Series (1, 2 and 3) and the Day the Universe Changed (with James Burke)...Also, A Brief History of Time."

The views of our life here on this little blue marble seemed so insignificant compared to the vastness of the cosmos. It came to pass then my views on science and technology forever changed and turned my life around. One of the most significant features of the series was the selection of soundtrack music. It was also an example of appreciation for the finer things in life that we take for granted. For anyone with even the slightest interest in space and technology truly needs to spend time in the \"Cosmos\" to get a view of our world from a different perspective. Bottom line, true brilliance and creativity at its best."

      "title": "This TV Show Made Me Who I Am",
      "content": "I was 13 years old when COSMOS premiered on PBS in September of 1980 and amazingly as this may sound it was **THE** TV show to watch every week that year amidst my coterie of friends. Our science teacher pimped the show mercilessly and every week the day after the broadcast we would discuss what might have been mentioned, compare ideas on what we thought about it, and usually have some good laughs aping the wonderful speech habits of Dr. Sagan.He became one of my heroes, as important as The Bionic Man, Captain Kirk, Peter Gabriel and David Bowie. I promptly had my parents supply me with not only the hardcover book edition, but one of the ubiquitous hooded parka jackets that became Sagan's trademark ... though it took me a few years to warm up to the idea of the turtlenecks. One indication of in what high esteem COSMOS was held in our household is that -- cover your eyes, libertarians -- it was one of the few television shows airing after 7pm that we were \"allowed\" to watch in our household. My father was a professor of environmental sciences (my mom collaborated as a library archivist at the college which employed him) and was himself smitten not only by Sagan's emphatic encouragement of scientific method, natural sciences, and critical thinking based on empirical observation, but was also an avid classical music fan. No doubt he believed (quite rightly) that Sagan's populist method of teaching science crossed with his frequent use of Beethoven, Bach, Mozart and Vivaldi might encourage me to toss my Queen and Sex Pistols records into the trash and perhaps choose a life devoted to science.It didn't quite work out that way, though I did initially choose anthropology as a major when entering college half a decade later, and am sympathetic to the music of Mozart and Vivaldi in particular (the hallowed Vangelis album which contained the show's iconic theme music also found it's way into my library of records, right next to The Clash, Dead Kennedys, and Monty Python) but eventually chucked it all aside after a month of Biology 101, and transferred into Visual & Performing Arts, with an emphasis on Media Studies, video production, and experimental studios. Eventually clips from COSMOS found their way into some of my experimental video works, and one of Sagan's brilliant lines opened up the Master's Thesis in Studio Arts that I composed in 1997: \"The universe is not required to be in perfect harmony with human ambition.\" I am not sure who coined the phrase, but the most correct thing that can be said about Sagan's prose is that he was incapable of writing an uninteresting sentence. COSMOS is brimming with one interesting sentence after the other, and perhaps his greatest contribution to the human condition in regards to this show was to demonstrate that science was not necessarily an exercise in applied boredom. Science could be an exciting \"personal journey\" of discovery, and his enthusiasm for endowing his viewers with a zeal for critical thinking helped me to breeze my way through high school biology & chemistry, which made perfect sense by the time I encountered the ideas presented.COSMOS also encouraged the young people who witnessed it at the time that science could actually be COOL, and that it was cool to be smart, informed, inquisitive, and open to new ideas. It was also pretty far out television, and during the second year it was on the air as repeats I made a point to always watch the show while stoned on whatever marijuana that I could get my chubby little hands on. We used to joke about Carl Sagan \"smoking billions and billions of Quaaludes\", so imagine my surprise when it came out after his far to early death at the age of 62 that he was a lifelong cannabis user himself. Just like with chemistry, it makes perfect sense once you think about it, though these days it's almost impossible to watch some of the episodes without relating certain on screen mannerisms as being chocked up to Sagan having probably been completely baked during filming.One of my favorite moments from the show perhaps speaks most clearly for what endeared him to me: It's during a sequence when he discusses the social hysteria that gripped the earth in 1911 when it became clear that the Earth would pass through the trail of Halley's Comet, composed in part of cyanogen gas. An enterprising mind of the time made \"Comet Pills\" composed of unspecified substances that would ward off the toxic effects of the cometary residue, and Sagan had managed to find (or have re-created by a clever prop technician from the RPI iEAR studios it was filmed in, where I took a semester of experimental video arts as a scruffy graduate student) a jar of the Comet Pills. He opens the lid, removes one and says, \"Think I'll take one for later\" and pops it into the pocket of his famous corduroy jacket. Hilarious, but that's Carl Sagan for you, and I have always wondered if it got him off.10/10: Buy the DVD box set, even though some of the episodes have \"updates\" that intrude on the purity of the original production, though it helps to prove his cannon that science is a self-correcting process. Even Carl Sagan was bound to his own theory. I like that."

I love it for two reasons.First: Even for todays standards it is a well made documentation that will make you think about yourself and the world you live in. The Cold War may be over, but people are still as stupid as ever. Cosmos is not just a simple documentation about stars and planets with numbers, technobabble and nice pictures - it's a manifest for peace and understanding that EVERYBODY should see.Second: I remember when I used to watch the series when I was ten years old. I didn't miss a single episode. Cosmos may not have CHANGED my life - but it certainly gave it a new direction. It taught me to keep an open mind and to care more about my surroundings. When I saw Cosmos today, I felt again like the little boy I was two decades ago. I'm in awe of the whole world and the wonders of the Universe that surrounds every one of us.If you have kids: show it to them! If you want to know more about life on earth or on other planets: see it! If you think, ordinary documentations about outer space are too complicated to understand: see it! If you don't really care about the Universe, the stars and the planets, but you wonder what all the fuss is about: see it!In any case: SEE IT!!!"

      "title": "Greatest of All Time",
      "content": "Cosmos is, hands-down, the greatest educational series of all-time. Even the wonderful (and highly recommended) history series Connections can't hold a flame to the perfection of Cosmos. If you don't believe me, look at the user ratings.It makes me tear up that most of my friends and almost all Americans don't know what Cosmos is (or what \"cosmos\" means), yet they can name every Friends cast member and their character's name and quirks.Computer graphics have come a long way since 1980, and just a few minor scientific updates are needed, but the series was so far ahead of its time that other than the spaceship deck set, the hair, and the clothes, it doesn't seem dated in 2004. It won the Peabody and Emmy awards, and remains to this day the most watched PBS series of all time (600+ million viewers in 60 countries).The series is 13-hours, but ought to count as a three semester hour (~45 hours of class) Intro to Cosmology college course. Sagan's ability to communicate the essence of the cosmos and the history of scientific discovery is concise and absorbs the viewer.If ever there was a series that explained \"life, the universe and everything\" (an appropriate quote from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), Cosmos is it. Cosmos takes the viewer on a journey from the origin of the universe to the end of time and displays it as easily as looking at a calendar on a wall (literally, at least from the origin until present time!). Evolution of all life on Earth is condensed into a simple animation only a few seconds long. A detailed history of the origins and interactions between religion and science is engaging and sure to provoke discourse between viewers. The series also explores the massive capacities of information available in the brain and DNA (virtually wiping aside \"nature\" in favor of \"nurture\"). Cosmos details Mars and Venus and uses them to eloquently describe the \"greenhouse effect\" and its possible repercussions on Earth. I could describe episode by episode, by suffice it to say, it encompasses almost every \"big picture\" question one could ask.Some people knock Carl Sagan for seeming smug or turning from a researcher to a public entertainer. I think of his entertainment as education to a broader audience, and any smugness should be discounted in favor of the information being conveyed. Sagan did society a tremendous favor by making this series. This is the most digestible science series I've ever seen. This should be required viewing for all high school students (or elementary students in their later elementary grades).Whether you buy it, rent it, check it out from the library, or borrow it from a friend, watch this series. Thanks to Cosmos, you will have a better understanding of your universe.(Incidentally, Sagan's speech is suspiciously similar in style to Agent Smith's from the Matrix. I've never heard of Hugo Weaving crediting Sagan as an inspiration but, intentionally or not, the similarity is there.)"

Carl Sagan not only transmits the facts, but also and perhaps most important, his enthusiasm swoops down deeply into the spectator skin.Sagan (who hosts the series himself) magnificently shows that science is the art of solving Nature's mysteries. Every topic that is encompassed in Cosmos, is shown as so: Beginning in the knot, showing the big efforts that are made to untie it, and the final breath-out of the human mind prevailing over the (previously) unknown. Not only science, but everyday subjects are researched as well, such as astrology or the UFO phenomenon. History also shares a good role in Cosmos.Overall, the great production and the soundtrack make this series a MUST for everyone carrying a throbbing heart."

Beautifully weaving human knowledge into a 13 part series. He covers the entire landscape of understanding in some way; History, Biology, Genetics, Neuroscience, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, Religion and the relationships of all these with human politics throughout history and across cultures. It is quite a goal to hit and it is done masterfully. I clearly remember anticipation for the commencement of the series in 1980 when I was 9. It and many of the later science/natural world focused PBS series to follow (Nature, Nova,The Mechanical Universe) in the 80's were what inspired me to pursue a profession in engineering. I hold an electrical engineering degree because of shows like this. Here I am 25 years later discovering again the wonder of Cosmos. I've picked up the series as a gift for my children, yet unborn, that they may hopefully be similarly inspired by this masterful work of television at its best.Highiest possible recommendation.Regards,"

In Cosmos, Carl Sagan takes us on location to places in the world where the most important people and ideas in science and astronomy were born, and to places in outer space where those ideas have revealed the universe to us. Carl Sagan shares a sense of wonder that is both intelligent and humorous, while occasionally warning us of our capabilities of self-destruction. Though Cosmos was made during the height of the cold war, it still stands as a reminder of global problems and dangers we still need to resolve. This series has either consciously or unconsciously set the standard for the format of almost every hosted science show or series on Television since it was made, and it's no wonder. Carl Sagan is a charismatic and sincere authority on the subject matter, and the music score is mostly by Vangelis (Bladerunner, Chariots of Fire, 1492) Synergy, Tangerine Dream, Vivaldi, and more. The visuals are amazing and remain as relevant as they were on the release date."

      "content": "First aired in 1980 this series, written and presented by astronomer Carl Sagan, has one of the most ambitious aims of any documentary; to teach us about the vast Cosmos around us. From distant galaxies, nearby stars and the planets around us to the history of life on our planet from its ancient beginnings to modern humanity. There is also speculation; is there more life out there on other planets and if so what is it like? Will we ever find proof of such life or will we somehow destroy ourselves? There is also the history of science and scientists from ancient Greece to the renaissance to modern times.The success of this series is largely down to Carl Sagan; his presentation shows his passion for the subject and this passion is passed on to the viewer. I first watched the series as a child and found it awe inspiring; especially the then recent revelations about our solar system revealed by various probes; most notably the two Voyager missions. Watching again thirty five years later the series feels almost as fresh as it did then; some of the science has obviously progressed but this doesn't feel dated and the DVD does include some 'science updates'. The special effects might show their age slightly at times but that doesn't distract from the information Sagan is trying to impart."

      "title": "Simply the greatest science miniseries in TV history",
      "content": "Cosmos. Just saying the name evokes memories of science's best and most eloquent educator, Carl Sagan. By no means a slouch in the scientific field -- he was a planetary scientist who first hypothesized and presented the idea of \"nuclear winter\" -- Sagan will forever be known for a phrase he never said: \"billions and billions\" (it was actually die-hard Sagan fan Johnny Carson parodying his science idol). Make all the jokes you want about Sagan's plosive enunciation of \"billions\" (which he always did to make it distinct from \"millions\"), Sagan defined what makes great science television for a generation.The 13 episodes of this Peabody and Pulitzer willing miniseries touch on nearly every science topic of importance: astronomy, cosmology, physics, biology, the mathematics of gigantic numbers, and relativity. It also indulges us in a targeted survey of science history, including sections on the Library of Alexandria, the birth of science experiment, the defeat of ancient Greek science by mysticism, and the lives of Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe (the original Odd Couple), James Goddard, and Edwin Hubble.Episodes 1, \"On the Shores of the Cosmic Ocean\", and 13, \"Who Speaks for Earth?\", provide matching capstones for the other 11 volumes, which jump wildly from topic to topic. And yet there is a coherency across the entire run. Whether Sagan is describing conditions on the surface of Venus, the effects of relativity, or the futility of writing out a googolplex, Sagan is our patient, encouraging, engaging guide, making sense to the layman of complex scientific concepts. The script, written by Sagan and future wife Ann Druyan, educated and entertained. Only occasionally did Sagan's delivery approach pretentiousness, but his own enthusiasm for the topics effectively foils any from creeping in.If you've read one of the Sagan biographies that emerged after his premature death in 1996, you'll know that one of the most effective and clever devices used in the series, the \"Ship of the Imagination\", was actually forced upon Sagan by executive producer Adrian Malone. This was one of the very few times that Sagan was wrong, because Malone's concept allowed us to step into cosmological situations much more believably than if we were presented simply with Sagan's exposition.Although by all accounts the two men hated each other to the point of fisticuffs, Sagan and Malone's production surpassed all previous efforts at science documentary and continues to set the standard for all who have come since. Now that the Sagan family's feud with Turner has been resolved, it is now available on DVD.A previous reviewer wrote, a plain simple \"wow\" just isn't good enough. Cosmos is, by the judgment of any person on this planet, one of the top 5 television productions in history."

Sagan's series is an example of how TV can be. The new release includes appendices after some of the episodes, recorded ten years later, in which Sagan, showing signs of the cancer that would kill him in three short years, adds new information without changing anything from the original episode. The man was so prescient, using terms like global warming and intelligent design, before they had entered our collective consciousness. Cosmos satisfies those interested in astronomy, life sciences, history, philosophy, sociology -- so wide is the breadth of topics it covers. It is something all of us should have in our DVD libraries."

      "title": "Life, The Universe & Carl Sagan",
      "content": "(Note: This review is based on the 2000 DVD release version of the series)This year (2010) is the thirtieth anniversary of the original PBS airing of Cosmos. A thirteen part documentary series, it won both an Emmy and a Peabody Award at the time of its original broadcast and has subsequently become the most watched PBS program in the world (and held the U.S record for a decade until Ken Burns' The Civil War aired). Not bad for what on the surface would seem to be a long documentary on space. Cosmos though is far more then just that though. Cosmos is an epic journey with few boundaries and many lessons. Thanks to its host Carl Sagan and its three writers (Sagan, Ann Druyan and Steven Soter) Cosmos covers a wide range of topics. These range from the origins of life, its evolution from single cell to modern humans, the ongoing battles between science and superstition, our own evolving outlook on the universe, our fascination with the planet Mars (the subject of the fifth episode \"Blues for a Red Planet\"), the complexity of the human brain (episode 11 \"The Persistence of Memory\"), the possible existence of extraterritorial life and our species own survival in the future to name a few of the topics covered in the series. As a result, Cosmos touches on a huge variety of topics that covers much of the human condition and the universe around us at the same time. While some of the science is inevitably out of date after three decades, this is made up for by the afterwords at the end of most episodes and the series has actually predicted a number of things as well (such as the early version of the rovers now exploring Mars seen in the fifth episode). Despite some of the science being out of date, Cosmos is still remarkable for the sheer number of topics in covers on its journey.It makes that journey thanks to fine production values. The series takes Sagan around the world to countries such as India, Egypt, Italy, Japan, France and Mexico along with places across the United States as well such as Sagan's old elementary school where he speaks to children and the Very Large Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico). These foreign locations can also be seen in numerous historical segments that explore the history of astronomy or various events and people throughout history as well such as Johannes Kepler or Jean-François Champollion who became the first person in modern times to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs. To take us beyond the Earth and out into the universe, the series gives us a \"Spaceship of the Imagination\" based on a a dandelion seed that becomes a reoccurring motif throughout the series. While its interior is exactly what you'd expect out of a 1970s science fiction spaceship, the places it takes the viewer to are not. The effects of the series (at least those not augmented and/or replaced by CGI versions) stand up rather well today such as Sagan walking through a recreation of the library of Alexandria, the beautiful \"galaxy rise\" seen at the end of episode nine \"The Lives Of Stars\" or the simple effects used to create the supernova seen in that same episode. Last but not least, perhaps, is the use of music throughout the series from a wide range of sources both classical and more modern including the opening music or the use of Holst's \"Mars The Bringer Of War\" to help create perhaps the definitive screen version of the famous opening paragraph from H.G. Wells The War Of The Worlds to name but two examples. The result is that Cosmos continues to stand up well even against more modern documentaries and is made even more effective as a result.The series greatest strength may well be in its host, Carl Sagan. Cosmos opening sequence subtitles it \"A Personal Voyage\" and Sagan, one of the most famous scientists of the late twentieth century, makes Cosmos just that. Sagan's sense of wonder and excitement is evident throughout and it is those attributes that makes the potentially dull parts of this series (dull as in topic you might not personally be interested in) worth seeing. That is in large part because of Sagan's ability to bring abstract concepts (such as the mathematical parts of Episode 10 \"The Edge of Forever\" or the Drake equation in Episode 12 \"Encyclopaedia Galactica\") down to a level that almost anyone should be able to understand and find exciting. A great example of that lies in the statement by Sagan at the beginning of episode nine: \"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\" which allows Sagan to take us on a journey from the impossibly small (atoms) to the impossibly large (stars, black holes etc). The series also illustrates Sagan's fears about our species seemingly ingenious ability to find new and more deadly ways of destroying ourselves, especially in the form of nuclear weapons. These fears are best expressed in the final episode of the series \"Who Speaks for Earth?\" and its haunting dream sequence. Sagan though makes sure that this journey is one that shows us that if we can survive our species destructive tendencies, our greatest accomplishments are still ahead of us. As a result, Cosmos is both an epic journey and a personal one as well thanks to Sagan. It is an epic journey not just across time and space but from the incredibly small to the incredibly large and from our species darkest moments to our greatest accomplishments. It is a personal journey thanks to Sagan, his sense of wonder and excitement about us and our universe. Perhaps its message is summed up best by Sagan himself:\"The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to stars.\"May we indeed."

Whether focusing on the outer reaches of space or the tiniest atom on earth, \"Cosmos\" lays out our place in the universe. At the same time, Sagan reminds us that our use of technology can either improve our living standard or wipe out all life as we know it. Judging by the present, it's too bad that Sagan isn't around any more. He would be doing more than anyone to counter all the anti-intellectualism promoted by the Tea Party types.A lot of \"Cosmos\" IS a little hard to follow due to all the scientific lingo, but it's still something that everyone should see to understand our place in the universe, as well as understand what we need to do to preserve our planet."

As relevant now as when it first aired, the DVD also has some updates that augment the information and continues the various line of thinking. Each episodes is well constructed in themes, content and adds to the growing intrigue. Sagan makes science fun and relatable while not losing much in accurately describing our headways and the questions that remain.A masterpiece. A must. Like \"The Human Animal\" (1994) a series that should be part of everyone's culture and education. A basis for many interesting thoughts and discussions."

It won an Emmy and a Peabody Award and was viewed by over half a billion people.Not merely a dry, didactic statement of facts, COSMOS appeals to such a wide audience because Sagan makes every episode, every topic, every nuanced syllable as interesting as possible, using props, special effects, reenactments, shooting on location around the world - the brilliant scientist himself, turtled to the neck, the most interesting prop of all.COSMOS is also an optimistic cry to humanity; an understanding of our place in the universe; a plea that we are all in this together on a small blue rock drifting in an endless ocean of night...It has dated, yes, and the special effects look quaintly chumbly-wumbly (especially the hokey \"Spaceship of the Imagination\" Sagan supposedly travels the cosmos in), but COSMOS is a perfect example of what the methodology of science is: a continually-changing facility, presenting the facts from evidence gleaned up to that point, but knowing those facts will change with more precise measurements, images, monitoring, researching - and welcoming those changes. No one - not even Sagan himself - would claim this series or his book of the same name was the ultimate be-all and end-all of knowledge (matter of fact, in 2005 The Science Channel rebroadcast COSMOS with updated computer graphics, new satellite photos of our solar system's planets, and digital sound). It was a placeholder until more current facts could be verified about the nature of things.Even so, COSMOS is one helluva placeholder, Sagan bringing together strands of philosophy, sociology and science into a fascinating wrecking ball of entertaining intellectualism."

Carl Sagan, an astronomer and one of the greatest popularizers of science of all time, addresses in this 13 episode series some of the more profound questions that humans sometimes find themselves asking. \"How did we get here?\" \"What lies out in space beyond the Earth?\" Sagan does it all through a scientific point of view, while still keeping it personal and easy to understand for the audience.Don't think that just because Cosmos is from 1980 that it is outdated. It is a very well done series, and the themes that it addresses are just as relevant to today's world as it was when this program first came out. While it mostly focuses on scientific topics such as space exploration, evolution, and the human brain, it also brings up topics like nuclear disarmament and the danger of believing in superstition. While Sagan makes sure that every statement he says is supported by evidence, he is not afraid to say that, at least at the time, there are some things in the universe that science simply does not know.Using plenty of visuals and layman's terms, Sagan does a good job to make sure the viewer doesn't feel alienated from the complex issues that this series tackles. Cosmos is not some cold educational program. It is also very emotional, showing us how small we are in the universe and how fragile our planet actually is. Watching this series has allowed me to understand some basic things about the universe that I never even considered—\"In order to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\" I wholeheartedly recommend this program to any human capable of thinking. Even if you think science is only something that a small, eggheaded elite can understand, watching Cosmos: A Personal Voyage should be more than enough to change your mind, and give you more of an idea exactly what our place is in the universe."

      "title": "\"The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.\"",
      "content": "Imagine if you will a tv series that manages to seamlessly combine elements of humor, fear, sadness, history and intrigue all while having a scientific undertone that introduces the viewer to the virtually endless wonders of outer space. I can't really decide if Cosmos is my absolute favorite series of all time, but it sure comes close. Broadcasted in the early 1980s, Cosmos took audiences on an incredible journey through the solar system and beyond that is so impressive it still remains unmatched 40 years later. Hosted and narrated by the legendary Carl Sagan, this show is so immense and covers such a wide variety of things that it's going to be quite hard for me to put it into words. Basically, it is comprised of 13 episodes, each with a different theme, but they are all focused on space and planets/stars far beyond our world. This show can actually be unintentionally depressing for many people, since it makes you realize how truly small the planet earth is when compared to the rest of the universe. Stars are so far away from us you couldn't reach them even if you traveled your whole life, a remarkable object called Halley's comet only appears once every 76 years, and the sun will explode one day, disintegrating the earth and killing everybody on it. Sagan approaches these admittedly unhappy proposals not with emotion, but in the name of science. He shows how everything in nature (on earth and elsewhere) is part of a big cycle, how death is the end of life, and how the end of life is nothing humans need to fear. The series also has something very special about it, and is something that sets it apart from all other science related shows. Sagan manages to successfully combine human history into each episode, and the surprising thing is that it works. I wouldn't have expected a series about space to have such an emphasis on man and his place in the universe, but in order to understand the universe, we must first understand ourselves. There's one scene in the first episode where he tells a story about how someone in the ancient world managed to accurately calculate the dimensions of the earth with no access to advanced computers or anything we have today. Cosmos is one of very few series that I can watch again and again and not get bored of it. It has such a huge array of topics inside it that it can be considered a universe in and of itself. The music in the show is also memorable, and a lot of it is done on a synthesizer by a musician called Vangelis. A lot of classical music is used as well, which helps make the things Sagan discusses feel intelligent and important. In one episode, he travels to Italy and goes to the town Leonardo da Vinci was born in. Sagan explains how traveling near the speed of light causes time for the traveler to slow down, and so they age biologically slower than people still on earth. To the travelers, they've only been gone for a few minutes, but from earth's point of view, they've been away for many decades. Most of their friends back on the planet are dead. He also mentions how humans have been on earth for about 200 thousand years, which may sound like a long time, but it's not. If you condense the entire history of the universe into a calendar year, with the Big Bang on January 1st, humans only started to exist in the last 10 seconds of the last day of december. Everything humans have ever done and accomplished is nothing compared to the age of the universe. Sagan doesn't just focus on depressing aspects of science like that though. A large number of happy and wondrous moments are shown, and it will make viewers understand their place in the universe. For example, Carl says how every single human being on earth is composed of elements found in nature, which illustrates how everything in existence is connected in some way. The carbon in our skin, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our blood, the phosphorus in our teeth, and the radioactive potassium in our cells. Every human being on earth is made up of these things (and more elements), and everything on earth and the universe is also made up of elements. By understanding this, you understand that we must respect nature because humans are a part of it. Much like Sagan says in one episode, if we ruin the earth, there's nowhere else to go. Evolution has done its job for millions of years, slowly but surely shaping cells and molecules into the lifeforms we are today. Sagan shows us that even though we were born too early to explore the limitless expanses of the universe, in our minds, we are free. Free to theorize and discuss and dream about what exciting or dangerous adventures lie in humanity's path during the next couple of centuries. Will humans ever reach other stars or solar systems? Will people live on mars? Is it worth spending 50 years on a spaceship to reach a faraway planet? Our generation will never know, but we can make scientific guesses. Much like Carl says in one of the later episodes, the Voyager spacecraft launched in the 70s contains a record with some of mankind's most popular songs. Thousands of years into the future, some other civilization may find the record and listen to it. They probably won't understand anything, but it will be clear that humans were a brave species who sent some of their achievements into the vast emptiness of space hoping that someone will recognize them. I typically watch this entire series from beginning to end every summer, and the occasion is already upon me. With such a huge amount of extremely interesting scientific facts, history, religion, stories, theories and events, it is clear why Cosmos is probably the best science-centric tv program I have ever seen. It's a very unusual thing to see a movie or show that is so incredible it leaves you with absolutely no complaints, but that appears to be the case here. It is simply perfect in all respects. Seriously, it's one of the best things ever put on television."

But along with our advancements, equally has our problems grown aswell, our planets natural habitats have shrinked extremley fast since the start of the 21st century which was discussed about in depth with David Attenborough's A Life on Our Planet, but back to Cosmos.Even though I enjoyed A Spacetime Oddesey and Possible Worlds and think they are masterpieces for current day, nothing beats the original and is a gift that everyone deserves to see and form their own opinions on. The beauty of Cosmos is that Carl is able to explain complex information in ways that are easy to understand without diluting the information or make you feel like you're being talked down to.I'm not saying that this documentary is impossible to top because it's not. I'm sure future documentaries like the Neil deGrasse Tyson ones have surpassed it technically and in the information, but Carl Sagan is irreplaceable, and his message becomes more important and prominent over time, and this was his gift to the world."

A nice, casual guy who wears sports clothes and speaks mellifluously, Sagan knows what he's talking about and gives us an occasional personal or humanitarian gloss. He's one of those professors, like Vincent Scully, who seems genuinely awed by the things he's describing.A stellar list of advisors, artists, and animators suggests the enormous effort that went into this project.I don't expect to see anything more entertaining, informative, and inspiring about this subject."

      "content": "A emotionally moving show about the wonders of understanding science, how science works, and the hearts and minds of those who follow the rigors of science, Carl Sagan gives us the history of scientific thought as well as the hearts and minds that created that history.This is one of my favorite TV series. It's not so much a science show so much as a show about science. There's a few scientific tidbits tossed in here and there by Carl Sagan to highlight an example of thought in a historic context, but there's no in depth analysis of any single field of science. Sagan will talk about chemistry, physics, astronomy, biology, mathematics, but will never go through the step by step process of explaining a simple chemical equation, and then balance it as teaching exercise.Instead, what Sagan does is take us down the road of science, explaining the historic context of developments and modes of thoughts from various historic figures. Everyone from early paleolithic man, to Ptolemy, to Keppler, to Einstein, to Hawking and all figures in-between. He shows us the times these people live in, the politics and the things that were deemed important that influenced the great scientific discoveries. Sagan will explain the discoveries, and then go on to show the ramifications of those discoveries. The wars, the superstitions, the ebb and flow of political thought, including religion.Carl Sagan take a real poetic stance on his view of science, and the miracle of existence. He divulges his thoughts and feelings as objectively as he believes he can, but also takes a few jabs at contemporary geo-politics with his accented deliver on words like \"mushroom clouds\", commenting on the then global contention between the US and USSR. In short, as full of good feeling a he is for science, and as much as he proselytizes objectivity, Sagan himself isn't always objective when delivering an opinion.Even so, the bulk of the show is in regards to how to understand science without having to understand the mathematical and other operative minutiae that bars many a common person from fully appreciating science, scientific discoveries and applications thereof.One might call Sagan's series The Emotion of Science, but it's more than just a cathartic release of scientific appreciation. It's a culmination of scientific thought, theory and, as stated earlier, how man's history shaped our present day understanding of science.Meant for all ages it's probably best appreciated by pre-adolescents and older. Though rather dated by today's standards, the core thoughts of Sagan's philosophy on science still hold true. Shot on 16mm and 1\" video, the visuals do have a marginally \"rustic\" feel to them, but again, the substance of the material presented is still very meaty to the intellectually curious.As always, I have some bones to pick. First and foremost is Sagan's condescension on the Cold War. I often wonder what newspapers or news' shows some of the higher-minded types relied on to explain the politics of the time. One wonders if Sagan would have preferred doing science under the aegis of a Soviet state than say the U.S. or Great Britain. That truly does bother me... but I digress.Anyway, give it a spin on the old DVD player, and see what you think of it. Try not to take Sagan's political commentary too seriously, and you got yourself one great show.Enjoy :-)"
