      "question": "Does L knows that Light is Kira?",
      "answer": "Whenever 'L' said any possibility he would reverse the rating (if he would be 10% shore than he would say he is 90% shore). That means when he said that he is 1% shore that Light is Kira, he already knew who he actually was, but Light was clearly Smarter than L. and he made him believe that he wasn't Kira, But L. still had a feeling the Light was Kira and he didn't know much about the notebook at the time he died so he died not knowing if light was kira or not he just suspected Light."
