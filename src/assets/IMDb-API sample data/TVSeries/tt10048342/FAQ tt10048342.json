      "question": "Have any chess experts examined the chess moves for authenticity?",
      "answer": "Yes. The program consultants are former World Chess Champion Grandmaster Garry Kasparov and National Master Bruce Pandolfini, a well respected chess: trainer; coach; author and player.In the last featured game: the first 36 moves are from a game played at Biel Interzonal (1993) between Vassily Ivanchuk v Patrick Wolff, Grandmaster Ivanchuk: former board one of USSR later Ukraine; arguably the strongest player never to become world champion. Grandmaster Wolff twice American Champion. As with other games in the series, it varies at some point. From move 37 powerful chess engines confirm the moves are virtually perfect.One of the speed games is the famous Paul Morphy \"Opera\" game, often considered the most beautiful game ever played.Most of the games in the series have been analyzed on the internet and the analysis can be watched on YouTube. They are all remarkably authentic.Still, there's a remarkable mistake - of all games - just before the final sequence of the final match between Harmon and Borgov when the positions at the public game board (in particular line 3) do not coincide with the \"real\" game. Look, for example, at the white bishop at D3 (public board) which is actually a black bishop (E3) in the actual match."

      "question": "Why didn't Beth's last name change when she was adopted?",
      "answer": "When a child is adopted, the Commonwealth or State issues a new birth certificate naming the adoptive parents. However, the child's name is not changed automatically, that's optional. Beth Harmon may have wanted to keep her mother's name."

      "question": "Do players really move that quickly in competitive matches?",
      "answer": "I believe that the first 10 moves of a game are \"theory\" and based of recorded games. I think most players try to spend 5 to 10 seconds or less to save time, if you spend 1 minute on the first 10 moves this is mind blowing, and too slow or a blunder. Especially in timed games. That is a brief explanation, hope it helps."

      "question": "Are there major differences between the series and the novel, especially in the ending?",
      "answer": "There are a number of mostly minor changes with regards to the novel, but the ending is unchanged with Beth happily playing a game of chess in a park in Moscow. The series is actually remarkably similar to the novel.In contrast to the series Beth has brown hair in the novel and her parents passed away a few years apart of each other without any of the drama shown in the series. There is no indication her mother tried to kill her in her suicide, or even that her mother killed herself.In the novel Townes isn't gay but still despite Beth's hopes and desires nothing except chess happens in his hotel room in Las Vegas. He doesn't show up last minute as her support at the match against Borgov in Moscow.Jolene is a more complex and morally ambiguous character in the novel, which includes a disturbing passage in which a 12-year-old Jolene sexually abuses an 8-year-old Beth.A major difference is that in the book after days of binge drinking and popping pills alone at home, Beth is actually the one reaching out to Jolene and asking for help to overcome her addiction problems. Only later during her recovery will Beth learn that Mr. Shaibel has passed away.The Cleo character never appears in Paris. Beth simply fails to beat Borgov and returns home to start her alcoholic binge."

      "question": "Will there be a second season?",
      "answer": "This is highly unlikely. In fact, one of the criticisms aimed at the show is that it would have worked better as a two hour film than as a seven hour mini-series.However, at the end of the novel Beth is contemplating her possible world championship match with Borgov in two years and the candidates matches she would have to play, which provides an opening."
