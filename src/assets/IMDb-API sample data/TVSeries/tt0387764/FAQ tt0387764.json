      "question": "What does Jeremy live on?",
      "answer": "Mark's kindness, mostly. Early episodes show him badgering Jeremy about overdue rent, but then he seems to let it go, later saying in a series 5 episode \"You don't pay rent.\" Jeremy gets his spending money from occaissional brief spells of employment, claiming benefit, handouts from his mother and sometimes he comes into little bits of money through luck (though often there's a catch)."
