Unfortunately only one person is interested in taking on the post, obscure junior minister Nicola Murray. True she is very keen but she also has a fear of lifts, a husband whose firm gets government contracts and a daughter about to start at a private school. Tucker is appalled but the only other likely candidate is his left bollock with a smiley face on it so he has to steer Nicola very carefully through a by-election poster...",

So it is not a good time to learn that 'somebody' in the department has accidentally wiped the immigration records of 170,00 people over the past few months. Nicola has a press meeting with hostile Guardian journalists coming up and Tucker must ensure that they do not get to learn of the mistake. Needless to say they do and when Glenn refuses to obey her by sacking secretary Robyn as the scapegoat Nicola feels even more undermined.",

Glenn does end up with a little T.L.C. and Nicola's speech could have been a lot worse, given that Terri was asking Robyn to provide jokes for her.",
