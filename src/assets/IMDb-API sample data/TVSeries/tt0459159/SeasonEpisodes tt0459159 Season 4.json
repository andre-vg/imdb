Spin doctor Stewart Pearson, on PM's orders, instructs him to launch an education initiative, to the annoyance of junior minister Fergus and the embittered Glenn. Glenn is supported by Terri, who is fed up and wants redundancy. Peter's brief is to launch an Apps initiative in a local school but the press conference shows him to be wholly out of touch with the subject. Ultimately he must reconcile with Fergus at a further press call to gain street cred - and just about does it.",

As Remembrance Sunday approaches Nicola feels the party should be realistic and agree with two unpopular policies of the government that they previously opposed. Tucker is appalled - as are the rest of the party - and things get worse when the press photograph Helen on the street with the notes from the policy meeting. Tucker is supportive - to her face but is secretly grooming Dan Miller, as he feels Nicola will commit political suicide soon anyway. And her ...",

Then the news breaks that anti-government protester Tickel has killed himself. Everybody rushes to inform Mannion, who can only get a phone signal on his mobile by standing on a children's slide - in which embarrassing pose he is photographed. But there is worse ...",
