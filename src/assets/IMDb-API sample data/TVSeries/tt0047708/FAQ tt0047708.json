      "question": "Hello, I wonder if someone can help me. Between Hithcock's opening and the story itself, there was a short credits scene, depicting the title and the main actors in a card, with a short drum effect on the background. Does someone know the name of that theme? It was often played also during the story, usually when it reached its tensest moment. Thanks in advance.",
      "answer": "Are you referring to \"The Funeral March of the Marionette\" by Charles Gounod? That is the name of the \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" theme song."
