      "content": "Boardwalk Empire is one of the best shows I've ever seen. The acting and writing are as good as anything you'll see on tv. The production is also fantastic, the attention to detail is just incredible. It tells the story of Atlantic City politician/gangster, Enoch \"Nucky\" Thompson (Steve Buscemi), and how he runs the town both legally and criminally. He runs it with his brother Elias (Shea Whigham), who is also the Sheriff, and their gang of tough guys. It takes place during prohibition and Nucky is the #1 distributor of illegal alcohol. He does this while doing business with some of the most notorious gangsters in American history like Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Jim Colosimo, Arnold Rothstein, among others. There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this incredible show so just go watch it. You won't be disappointed!"

You've got historical true elements mixed of course with fictional aspects, more so on the fictional side but it's just amazing to see these actors play out some the most iconic historic mobsters, Stephen Graham as Al Capone is just amazing, one my top favourite actors to see on screen. And ultimately one the best endings to a show, with no spoilers the story comes full circle, with a satisfying end."

      "content": "With production values that are mind-boggling, cast, and a budget to die for HBO is now what film studios were in the 1930s, they have the clout and the ability to go way further than most films can - and you get episode after episode.the detailing is beyond accurate and lavish - every stitch, every furnishing, every telegraph wire looks and feels authentic and it is all shot and lit to the highest standards of film not TV. The story of prohibition and Atlantic City is fully detailed, complex, with Steve Buscemi heading up a great cast. I have a gripe that the F-word was not ubiquitous at the time and strikes a jarring note in an otherwise near perfect production. Where this shines is in the details - I just hope the story lines and acting live up to the promise - they certainly have so far."

Uncensored, gritty and with a very realistic tone. The characters are all extremly well-written and acted, and at its core it is very much the tale about the corruption and fall of man, the descent into crime and darkness; conveyed in Nucky and his surrogate son Jimmy. Just like Coppola tried to build upon in his epic.The writing, cinematography and themes are outstanding, as is its great and classic soundtrack. It just breathes classic Scorsese, and, like his other collaborations with Winter, this is a work of art for the ages.Recommended for any lover of film or the crime/mafi genre!"

Reminiscent of The Sopranos but set in the prohibition era, the attention to detail - from clothing, set design, to music draws you in and holds your attention.Steve Buscemi's performance captivates as it grows to eventually repulse, but still you root for him - top dog to underdog, to wanting out, you want him to make it out alive.Characters comes and go, the writing lags here and there, but overall the show is worth the time and attention required to fully appreciate its genius.I throughly enjoyed it & highly recommend it."

Actually the actors who played them are the perfect age now to play these historical characters, so hopefully the show runners give it a thought."

      "title": "\"I Am Not Seeking Forgiveness\"",
      "content": "Boardwalk Empire is a brilliant series, created by Terence Winter and exec produced by Martin Scorsese and Mark Wahlberg. It also showcases the work of director Tim Van Patton and many of the actors involved with The Sopranos-still the G. O. A. T. Yet, whilst Empire is one of the greats, in my book, it is on the second tier of that list. That is mostly because of the 5th Season, but I'll get to that later.Firstly, why it's a great series. Most of the key players are, both on and off the screen, Sopranos alum. Tim Van Patten is the best in the business. Steve Buscemi is compelling in his starring role role as 'Nucky Thompson' the Boss of Atlantic City. Buscemi continues the theme, established by The Sopranos, that character actors can carry a series. Kelly Macdonald also delivers as Nucky's protege-cum-lover-cum-wife-cum-nemesis-cum-friend. The standouts on the supporting cast include: Shea Whigham, Michael Shannon, Stephen Graham, Vincent Piazza, Michael Kenneth Williams, Charlie Cox, Gretchen Moll, Jack Huston, and Michael Stuhlbarg. Also, an admiring nod to the unique characters created by Michael Laciura and Stephen Root. Which brings us to Michael Pitt. What a shame no one wanted to work with him, such that his character was written out at least a season before I believe it was planned. He was a co-star and created a compelling, complicated character.The writing, when it's good, is first rate and unafraid to take its time and develop characters. The sets, costumes and photography are stunning. The attention to period detail is impressive. The story captures family, friendships, loyalty, betrayal, crime, politics, history and race relations-no mean feat. The best episodes of the series can hang their hat on any series' coat rack: 'To The Lost', 'Two Imposters', 'Margate Sands' and 'Farewell Daddy Blues' being my favorites. Best Season: Season 2.Now, let me explain why I only rate it in the bottom tier of first-tier series'. There are too many bad episodes, often back-to-back and sometimes back-to-back-to-back. The writing ranged from brilliant to sketchy to downright boring. My partial list of the worst episodes includes: 'Bone For Tuna', 'Ging Gang Goolie', 'What Does The Bee Do?', 'Resignation', 'Acres Of Diamonds', 'The North Star', 'William Wilson', 'The Good Listener', 'What Jesus Said', 'King Of Norway' and the ENTIRE 5th Season. In fact, I based my rating of a 9 stars on the first 4 Seasons. I would rate Season 5 as 2 stars. The series could have, and should have, ended with a 2 hour Season 4 finale. We did not need the deadly-dull, incessant flashback plot. We did not need to catch-up with the despicable Gillian. We did not need to bring Margaret back into the picture. We did not need Willie's startling and unexplained character turnabout. Season 5, hands down, is the worst season. I also would have preferred an ending for Enoch that mirrored that of the real-life character he was based upon."

      "content": "I am not a big TV lover. Mostly I watch South Park, but this show has gotten me interested in more live-action shows. It tells its stories with the same quality as a normal theater film for each episode making it feel like a massive crime drama experience. I have been waiting for a while now to review it, and now that the first season is over I can make my honest opinion clear. I live on a barrier island in New Jersey named Long Beach Island. It is about an hour drive away from Atlantic City so as you can guess I've been there a few times. My favorite part about Atlantic City is the boardwalk. Since this show is named Boardwalk Empire it should do a good job at showing what it looked like back in the 20's. Simply put it captures the 20's perfectly. The show is directed so well I felt like I was transported back to those days. They also capture the feel of the 20's in other ways by showing historic events such as the World Series scam. In the end though it best captures the spirit of the 20's on the boardwalk. As for the plot it is set in the 1920's. Prohabition has begun starting a whole decade of illegal alcohol smuggling. The Treasurer of Atlantic City Nucky Thompson is starting a smuggling business that results in some bloody consequences. Along the way he meets a woman named Mrs. Schroeder, deals with an oncoming election, and more. It is a very well told story. It manages to tell several different stories throughout the show, but none of them feel underdone. They all are extremely well put together story lines. You have the main alcohol smuggling story, the story of Nucky and Margaret, the story of Jimmy, the story of Capone, the story of Lucky, the story of Eli Thompson, the story of Agent Nelson Van Alden, and many more. All these different stories keep things fresh. The emotions that are shown in the episodes are powerful. As the episodes go on emotions get stronger like layers of an onion. Something that is also present in this show is flare. Every gangster flick needs that style to it. It needs to have that gangster feel. While this show doesn't have a lot of that when it happens it is really cool. Now I end this review on the acting. Everybody does a swell job. Buscemi is great as usual, and everyone else is great. The person who I'm most interested in is Michael Pitt who is a relatively unknown actor, but here is great and I would like to see him other things. He could make it real big. Overall I love this show. I will be a viewer of the next season for sure."
