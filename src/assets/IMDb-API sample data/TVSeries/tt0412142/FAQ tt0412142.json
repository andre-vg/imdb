      "question": "Why does House never have any money? He earns the same as the other department heads and doesn't have a family to keep. Wilson has three ex-wives and has paid alimony to one or more at any one time, yet he bails out House all the time. (BTW, why does Wilson have to pay alimony anyway - there weren't any children from those marriages.)",
      "answer": "House likes to spend his money on other things (such as musical instruments, hookers, monster truck events, etc) but it's implied he simply just mooches off Wilson and Wilson doesn't put a stop to it. (also implied that house likes to test people evident in one episode where he asks money from Wilson to buy a motor bike , he immediately pays it and explains that he wanted to test how much he would lend him.) It's never outright explained but it can be assumed that House just has a decent amount of savings that he uses as well due to the fact that he was able to keep his apartment at times when he's not working (rehab in Season Six or prison in Season Eight). No one ever really clarifies this though but it's commonly accepted due to how House and Wilson are characterized.Wilson paying alimony despite not having children might also just be a character choice by the producers because he goes out of his way for people if he screws up (ie. he tried to write a check that is assumed to be six thousand dollars to a patient who he misdiagnosed in Season 4's episode Games)."

      "question": "What is House M.D. about?",
      "answer": "House is an American medical drama series that ran from 2004 - 2012. The series chronicles rogue doctor, arrogant jerk and drug addict Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) whom constantly clashes with his colleges as they diagnose and treat patient's illnesses, which House would accuse patients of lying and makes assumptions."

      "question": "Why is the cane on the wrong side? Is that a mistake?",
      "answer": "made this statement on a guest appearance of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992), Episode #13.198 (2005). It's also been stated by executive producer and writer David Shore that some people prefer to use the cane with their dominant hand regardless of which leg is injured.This was also addressed in .It is not a mistake. Biomechanically a cane should be used in the opposite hand when the injury is at the hip joint. If the injury is at the knee or below, it is more efficient and more biomechanically sound to hold the cane on the same side as the problem. In House's case the injury is involving muscles that are primary movers--specifically extensors--of the knee (he seems to be able to move the hip at will). It can be assumed, therefore, that the cane is to compensate for his knee instability; thus he is actually using it properly on the side of the injured leg.As someone who suffers from constant leg pain I would like to add that by carrying the cane on the same side as the bad leg you can put most of your weight on the cane and hardly even use your leg. If you use the cane on the opposite leg while it may help with stabilizing as you walk you can not put nearly as much of your weight on it thus putting more pressure on your painful leg.\" Bear weight on the proper side. You should hold your cane on the same side of your body that your injury is on. If you are using the cane for general mobility rather than an injury, hold the cane using your dominant hand and bear weight on this side of your body. This will make the cane bear the majority of your weight, as well as the impact caused by your motion when walking (eHow).\"[link]http://www.ehow.com/how_2050240_use-cane.html Edit"

    {
      "question": "Is There An Unaired Pilot Episode?",
      "answer": "There is a slightly longer version than the one that aired or is available in the boxset DVDs.A special DVD was distributed in some magazines prior to the initial premiere date for promotional purposes and it had about 4 minutes of additional material that was edited from the aired version.The additional material includes two deleted scenes. The first is an extended version of the scene where Wilson is trying to convince House to take on Rebecca Adler () as a patient. Just after he tells House that she's his cousin, House tries to enter an elevator, Wilson grabs his cane and won't let go until House agrees to see Rebecca.The second is an extended version of a scene that aired in \"Paternity (2004)\" where Chase is doing a crossword puzzle and asks Foreman for a 9-letter word meaning \"iodine deficiency in children\" (A: cretinism). In the scene, they discuss their specialties and how long they've each been working for House. Edit"

      "question": "Is there a real Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital? / Where is the hospital located? / Where is the show filmed?",
      "answer": "Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is fictitious.It was recently announced in the local newspaper (West Windsor Plainsboro News) that there is in the works a Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital in the works because the current Princeton Hospital wants to improve their facilities.The actual building filmed in the flyovers is not a hospital. Instead it is the Frist Campus Center at Princeton University. This building is the former Palmer Physics Lab and a new modern addition creating the main social center for students of Princeton University. The flyover includes the Princeton University Campus and the surrounding area. The flyover starts in Plainsboro, flies across the Carnegie Lake, which is very narrow and looks like a segment of a river, then travels towards Princeton University. Hence the name Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.The show is filmed in Los Angeles, California, at 20th Century Fox. Season one filmed on two sound stages: 11 and 14. Season two added an sound stage 15. The show occasionally goes on location to nearby locales around Los Angeles County. Also, the original was filmed in Vancouver, Canada. Outdoor scenes are usually filmed on campus at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) or the University of Southern California (USC). Edit"

      "question": "Does House ever wear a lab coat?",
      "answer": "He usually refuses to wear it since he doesn't want people to know he's a doctor. He's worn his lab coat only a few times throughout the series: the first time in to distract Vogler, and few more times when Vogler insisted that he wear it in Sex Kills (2006) and again in Games (2007) when he sat in as Wilson told a patient that he was not dying as he'd been told earlier.In Season 5, he also puts on the lab coat in Joy to the World (2008) as he's trying to act like a friendly doctor, in order to get a Christmas present from a patient. In season 7's Family Practice (2011),\" he wears his lab coat when he's talking to Cuddy's sick mother, Arlene. Edit"

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is House such a jerk?",
      "answer": "Well, there are many theories as to why.Amongst those that find House to be a jerk, most like to believe that he became nasty after the infarction in his leg that he refused to have amputated and instead lives with chronic leg pain and struggles with a Vicodin addiction. This argument can be refuted, as in the episode #1.21 (\"Three Stories\"), Cameron asks Stacy what House was like before the problems with his leg. Stacy replied he was \"pretty much the same,\" so we don`t know for certain whether or not the leg caused his current behaviour.Another theory is that he is miserable because he was abused by his father when he was younger as explained in Season 3, Episode 12.Eventually we will find out more about his past but for now, those who think he is a jerk believe the writers are keeping his past as ambiguous as possible is part of the mystery of the show.And there are many people who don't believe he is a jerk. He wasn't a jerk with Stacy. Both Allison Cameron and Lisa Cuddy, along with a woman House met while serving his time in a mental institution (she was there visiting another patient), are or were all in love with House as they see him as a man who is confident, intelligent to a degree only other tortured geniuses could understand (as shown in the episodes where he treats other lonely, tortured geniuses, some of them musical geniuses, some of them logical geniuses, etc...), and with a sense of humour which, if you \"get him,\" is really very funny. Wilson, deep down, doesn't believe House is a jerk.House also, as Cameron points out, doesn't do things out of pure ego or selfishness, but rather does things because they are \"right.\" Nobody questions House is a smart-ass, or that he's afraid of commitment, but to those who actually like House, they believe he is a beneficent smart-ass, not a malicious one.Thus, this question becomes difficult to answer authoritatively. The above allows reasoning for those who believe he is a jerk, but, in fairness, also acknowledges those who believe otherwise."

    {
      "question": "Why doesn't House just go to rehab to get off Vicodin, or try something else to distract himself?",
      "answer": "As a matter of fact, in season 3, after a renegade detective (Dt. Tritter) tries to put House in jail for being under the influence of narcotics while treating patients, House goes to rehab as part of a deal with the DA to avoid jail time but Detective Tritter stills pursues him despite his attempts to get clean. House ends up in jail for one night on contempt but tells Wilson even though he will return to rehab he will still have his Vicodin because he has an orderly on his payroll.After House is shot in season 2, he requests a special treatment from Cuddy that will eliminate his leg pain but he will still have to recover on his own from his gunshot wounds. He gets the treatment and ends up being able to run and walk without a cane or Vicodin but after a while the medicine wears off and he goes back to Vicodin.In season 5, House comes into work unusually happy and willing to \"humour\" a patient's family by allowing a useless treatment to be given to their son, the patient, to prove that it's useless. The team, Wilson and Cuddy deduce that House is on Heroin because in order for him to be pain free he would have to be on something stronger than Vicodin. Wilson confronts House about his suspicions and House reveals that he is actually on Methadone which relieves his pain and enables him to be nice to people. Cuddy tells him that in order to keep his job she would have to control his use of Methadone but he decides to quit because he feels that it makes him too soft which resulted in him causing more problems for a patient by humouring the family instead of going with his instincts.Lastly, Vicodin is for pain, which is why House takes it, despite the constant worries of others. Addiction and dependency are two different phenomena. Rehab is for addiction. Any pain patient will become dependent on opioid medications when taking them for extended periods, but this is not addiction. Many cancer patients must take them long enough to become dependent, however, they are not addicts that need drug treatment in a rehab, as someone taking them for non-medical reasons would."

    {
      "question": "How many different drugs has House used?",
      "answer": "House has been addicted to Vicodin for many years and despite many attempts to get clean he is still on it.In season 2, House took a special migrane prevention drug and than took a drug that would cause a migrane to try to prove that the migrane prevention drug didn`t work. He later took Acid to eliminate his migrane and then took anti-depressants to short circuit the LSD.In season 3, House stole Oxycodone from a pharmacy that was to be given to a patient who was already dead.In season 4, House takes a special azheimers medication to try and remember who he saw on the bus before it crashed.In season 5, House takes Methadone to wean himself off of Vicodin and eliminate his pain but quit after realizing that it made him too soft.In season 6, House is off Vicodin and is now only taking Ibuprofen as directed by his therapist, Dr. Nolan - but he does go back to face his problems before and after his breakup with Cuddy in season 7.In season 7, House steals experimental medicine, currently being tested on rats, causing his leg to strengthen, but it also leads to other side effects."

    {
      "question": "How long is House in the mental facility?",
      "answer": "House is only in the mental hospital for the season 6 premiere. He leaves at the end of the two-part episode. As for the fictional time he spent in the mental hospital, in Episode 5 of Season 6 House talks to Chase about Chase having a problem with having killed a patient, House tells Chase that he should go see a doctor (psychiatrist) since they could fix him in just 10 minutes since they only needed 7 weeks for himself, most likely he is referring to his time at the mental hospital."

    {
      "question": "What is a \"Free Clinic\" and do they really exist?",
      "answer": "A \"Free Clinic\" is just a walk-in doctors office. You don't have to pay for the medical visit, or it's really cheap. There are generally a lot of people, so they sometimes try to get you in and out as quick as possible. They do exist, usually in larger cities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do the patients understand House when he's making a sarcastic/witty comment?",
      "answer": "Almost every character and guest character on the show is intelligent. That includes the patients, their family, lawyers/cops/politicians, and others. All of them can think quickly and respond to a witty comment quickly. Although a non-doctor character doesn't understand the medical part of House's comments, they always get his point. Many patients are also experts or respected figures in their own profession/field, so they can often talk to House and his team on the same intellectual level."
    },
    {
      "question": "If House is so smart and experienced, why does he need three to four doctors to provide ideas?",
      "answer": "Before House asks his team to brainstorm on a case, he already knows the possible answers, and can likely solve many cases all by himself. However, it has been suggested that he can handle his leg pain much better, and generally can function better, when he's working with a team. The team investigate the patients' living and working environment. They do the tests such as MRI and biopsy. Many of these tests take a long time to complete and require multiple doctors working together in the lab. Many patients need to be observed by doctors overnight, so having multiple members in the team will provide enough manpower to do that. House's team members each specialize in a medical field, and he sometimes needs to consult them because one doctor can't possibly specialize in every field. Finally, Dr. Cuddy, and sometimes another character, needs his team member to spy on him or put a leash on him. It is a teaching hospital. His staff is learning diagnostic medicine from the master."

    {
      "question": "Which was the most watched episode?",
      "answer": "The most-watched episode of House is the season four episode \"Frozen\", which aired after Super Bowl XLII. It attracted slightly more than 29 million viewers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was House performing brain surgery when he's not a brain surgeon?",
      "answer": "The show tries to put a limit to the number of characters. Since every major character is a doctor, it would feel excessive to add more doctors during the surgery scenes (which they do do sometimes). The show tends to reuse existing characters, such as Chase, Foreman and House, to perform surgeries that they wouldn't be qualified to perform otherwise."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which non-doctor character appeared in the most episodes?",
      "answer": "An unnamed nurse seems to have appeared in the largest number of episodes, followed by Rachel Taub, Dr. Taub's wife."

      "question": "Are Chase and Cameron married in real life?",

      "question": "House gets on average one patient per week, as stated in episode 1. He has a team of three doctors to assist him. Yet Wilson has dozens of patients, and no team at all! This is a very strange anomaly. At first I thought Wilson's team was there, but invisible mostly, to avoid too many characters. But then when Wilson's prescribing licence is withdrawn he has to use House's team (and then refer his patients on when they don't co-operate). If he had his own team, then they could do the prescribing.",
      "answer": "The answer is simple: Wilson is an oncologist. He deals with only one diagnosis, which is cancer. He doesnt need a team for that. On the other hand, House is the head of his department and he needs 3 other doctors (each from different specialties), to help him with the different diagnosis that could came out."

      "question": "What happened to House's leg?",
      "answer": "He had an infarction in his right thigh.Similar to a clot that causes a stroke if it is in the brain, a heart attack if it is in the heart and an embolism if it is in the lung, an infarction in his leg blocked the flow of blood. House explains this in the \".\"It is further explained in \"Three Stories (2005)\" that his condition went misdiagnosed for three days causing severe nerve damage and muscle death. They wanted to amputate his leg but he opposed it. The surgery that tried to restore blood circulation and removal of dead muscle tissue left his leg permanently impaired and in chronic pain. Edit"

      "question": "Has everyone realized that House is similar to Sherlock Holmes? He even has the same address, 221b.",
      "answer": "Yes, we have. Creator based House on Sherlock Holmes because of his ability to solve the medical mysteries of his patients. You'll find lots of similarities to Holmes, who was in turn based on a real-life doctor by , so it's come full circle.In addition, Holmes and House have something else in common: both are drug addicts. House is addicted to the painkiller Vicodin and Holmes to injected cocaine.It should be noted, however, Vicodin, or Hydrocodone, is actually only a moderately powerful pain killing medicine. Tylenol 3, aka Acetaminophen with Codeine is the least powerful. Darvon or Darvocet, aka propoxyphene is the next least, and then you get to Vicodin, or Hydrocodone. There is, beyond that, in order of strength, Morphine, Percocet/Percodan, Oxycontin/Oxycodone (which is the main drug in the aforementioned Percocet and Percodan, but these come in higher doses), Methadone, Dilaudid, Demerol, and finally Fentanyl. Any and all of these can lead to addiction, however in people with no substance abuse history, use of these medications only lead to true addiction in under 1% of all users. Thus, Hydrocodone in significantly higher doses, especially the doses they made it appear House took, would not, under almost any condition, be the next step. Instead, they would just move to a more powerful drug.Holmes,. OTOH, smoked opium, aka \"chasing the dragon.\" FWIW, in the days Holmes used Opium, it was perfectly legal for him to do so both in the UK and the US.The show is named after a play on words (House = \"homes\" = Holmes). House's best friend James Wilson is named after Holmes' friend John H. Watson. Both Wilson and Watson were three times married.The man who shot House at the end of Season 2 is named \"Jack Moriarty,\" who shares the surname of Holmes' archnemesis.Holmes passed the time between cases by reading boring monographs; House passes time between cases by watching insipid medical dramas.Does everyone also realize that their personalities are completely alike? Both are brilliant, arrogant, and single-minded in their pursuit of the answer to their mystery. The only difference is that Holmes is much more refined than House.Arthur Conan Doyle partly based Sherlock Holmes on Dr. Joseph Bell, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, and eminent surgeon. (reference - Reader's Digest Strange Stories, Amazing Facts 1976, LCCC 76-2966, pages 554-555 - \"The Incredible Dr. Bell\") In season 5 Episode 11 \"Joy to the World\", House receives a Christmas present that turns out to be a book on surgery written by Dr. Joseph Bell. Also, in the season finale, House fakes his own death, as did Sherlock Holmes. Edit"

      "question": "What all does House see when he is hallucinating?",
      "answer": "His main vision is that of Amber, who he determines to represent his irrational mind. He notes this during a discussion with Wilson who says \"Your irrational mind is like my rational one.\"His second halluncination is Cuddy taking him home to detox and ultimately sleeping with him. He then continues this by seeing her lipstick in place of vicodin bottle. He figures out that it was all fake after announcing their tryst to the entire lobby full of nurses and fellows. She fires him.The final hallucination is Kutner. Who may simply represent his rational mind. However it is never stated why he sees the recently deceased doctor."

Also, Jennifer Morrison, the actress who plays Cameron, stated she was told she wasn't \"off the show\" and thus, could very well return at pretty much anytime, even though she was starring in ABCs Once Upon A Time.In the season 8 finale (the final season) Cameron returns to the show (but not to the department)."
