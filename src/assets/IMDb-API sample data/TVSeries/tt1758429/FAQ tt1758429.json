      "question": "Should I see this before Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Vengeance or War Of The Damned?",
      "answer": "It's recommended you watch them in the order they aired:Spartacus: Blood and SandSpartacus: Gods of the ArenaSpartacus: VengeanceSpartacus: War of the DamnedWhile this miniseries is a prequel to Blood and Sand, the very beginning and very end of Gods of the Arena spoil the ending to Blood and Sand. Also, there are some characters and plot developments that stem from Gods of the Arena in Vengeance. So it's recommended you watch this miniseries before Vengeance to understand them. However, if you are re-watching, it's quite enjoyable to watch GotA first."
