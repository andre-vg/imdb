Starlight cameras reveal previously unfilmed nocturnal behaviour of <span class=\"mw-redirect\">black rhinos</span> as they socialise at a Kalahari waterhole, and super slow motion footage captures a fierce battle between two male <span>giraffes</span>. Other sequences show Namibia's famous and mysterious <span class=\"mw-redirect\">fairy circles</span>, how a <span>fork-tailed drongo</span>'s talent for mimicry allows it to steal a meal from a <span>meerkat</span> clan, how <span>ostrichs</span> help their chicks find water, and how <span>red-billed queleas</span> defend their nests from marauding <span class=\"mw-redirect\">armoured bush crickets</span>. Also, for the first time, cameras enter the world's largest underground lake in <span>Dragon's Breath Cave</span> and film the critically endangered <span>golden cave catfish</span>. <i>Eye to Eye</i> looks behind the scenes of the rhino and giraffe filming.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep2\" style=\"text-align:center\">2</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Savannah\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">9 January 2013</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">7.52 million viewers</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #85a656\">East Africa is the subject of the second programme, from the glaciated peaks of the <span>Rwenzori Mountains</span> to the savannahs and caustic <span>soda lakes</span> of the <span>Great Rift Valley</span>. The filmmakers focus on the life and death decisions animals must make in this ever-changing region. On the savannah, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">agama</span> lizards play a <span>game of dare</span> as they approach a sleeping pride of <span>lions</span> to catch flying insects. Ancient forests in the Savannah are now roamed with <span class=\"mw-redirect\">mountain gorillas</span>. A <span>shoebill</span> chick is filmed attacking its weaker sibling, forcing the parents to abandon it. On the plains of <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Amboseli</span>, the worst drought for 50 years claims the life of an elephant calf, one of hundreds which perish from starvation. Their resilience and adaptability is highlighted by the returning rains, which bring together large herds to socialize. In <i>Eye to Eye</i>, cameraman Mark Deeble discusses the ethics of filming the dying elephant calf.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep3\" style=\"text-align:center\">3</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Congo\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">16 January 2013</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">7.97 million viewers</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #85a656\">The third episode visits the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Congo basin</span> and features some of the creatures which inhabit its two million square miles of jungle. In the canopy, a <span class=\"mw-redirect\">chimpanzee</span> is filmed extracting honey from a bees' nest using a variety of branches as tools, whilst underground, a female <span class=\"mw-redirect\">African rock python</span> incubates her eggs by coiling her warm body around them. Rare footage shows the nesting behaviour of <i><span class=\"mw-redirect\">Picathartes</span></i> and a gathering of <span class=\"mw-redirect\">forest elephants</span> at <span>Dzanga bai</span>. Other sequences show <span>African skimmers</span>, <span>leaf-folding frogs</span> and luminous fungi. <span>Loango</span> in Gabon is one of the few remaining places where the jungle meets the ocean. <span>African forest buffalo</span>, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">hippo</span>, elephants and <span>red river hogs</span> emerge from the forest to sunbathe and swim. <i>Eye to Eye</i> shows the difficulties of filming in the Congo.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep4\" style=\"text-align:center\">4</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Cape\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">23 January 2013</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">7.58 million viewers</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #85a656\">The fourth instalment shows how Southern Africa is influenced by two very different ocean currents. The warm <span>Agulhas Current</span> generates rainfall in Mozambique's interior, where butterflies gather on the summit of <span>Mount Mabu</span> to court and breed. The cold <span>Benguela Current</span> influences the Western Cape, where little rain falls. The intense heat makes incubating eggs a difficult prospect for <span>African penguins</span>. In spring, as <span>Namaqualand</span> is transformed into a desert garden, the drama of a <span>monkey beetle</span>'s love life plays out in a single flower. Springbok dance in the rainy season for joy. <span>Great white sharks</span>, a school of <span class=\"mw-redirect\">dolphins</span> 5000 strong, and a 15 m <span>Bryde's whale</span> are filmed in the rich feeding grounds of the Atlantic. <i>Eye to Eye</i> reveals how the opening sequence, documenting the first few minutes of a <span class=\"mw-redirect\">green turtle</span> hatchling's life, was constructed.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep5\" style=\"text-align:center\">5</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Sahara\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">30 January 2013</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">6.52 million viewers</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #85a656\">The penultimate episode opens in the cedar forests of the Atlas Mountains, where <span>Barbary macaques</span> have become isolated from other primates by the expanding <span>Sahara</span>. Aerial photography shows the Sahara is a landscape dominated by rock. Animals featured include <span>Grévy's zebra</span> and <span>naked mole-rats</span>, each found on the desert's fringes. Two million <span>barn swallows</span> are forced to cross the Sahara on their migrations, congregating at a poisoned oasis to feed on flies. The last remaining freshwater pools are home to stranded <span class=\"mw-redirect\">desert crocodiles</span>, filmed hunting <span>tilapia</span> fish. Macro photography reveals the struggles of <span>dung beetles</span> and <span>silver ants</span>, the latter able to survive exposure to the brutal midday sun thanks to their reflective body coating. <i>Eye to Eye</i> shows how an 18-month time lapse sequence of Libya's sand dunes was filmed.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep6\" style=\"text-align:center\">6</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"The Future\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">6 February 2013</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">6.58 million viewers</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #85a656\">The theme of the final programme is environmental issues affecting Africa's wildlife, including poaching, habitat loss, climate change and human population growth. Attenborough profiles the work of conservationists and scientists across the continent, drawing attention to projects which are helping to protect threatened species such as the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">black rhino</span> and the <span>mountain gorilla</span>. He visits a <span>Maasai</span> tribe to feature a project which is helping to reduce human-lion conflict, an underpass used by elephants to move between feeding grounds and a sea turtle rehabilitation centre. A civil war ravaged <span>Gorongosa National Park</span> in <span>Mozambique</span>, but concerted efforts are now being made to restore the whole ecosystem. <i>Eye to Eye</i> follows Attenborough on his <i>Africa</i> shoot, culminating in an encounter with a blind baby rhino.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>The series received critical acclaim.</p><br/><h3>Merchandise</h3><h4>DVD and Blu-ray</h4><p>The series was released in the UK as a three-disc DVD (BBCDVD3741) and Blu-ray (BBCBD0227) box set on 18 February 2013.
