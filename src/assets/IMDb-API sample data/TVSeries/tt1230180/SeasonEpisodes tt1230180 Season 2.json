      "plot": "With the upcoming release of the fourth Rambo movie, the Nerd reviews Rambo for the NES. The game suffers from four problems which are: confusing navigation on the landscapes, pointless chat options, unnecessary use of animals as enemies, and the idea of the screen blinking red when low on health. The Nerd also reviews some other Rambo games but couldn't find a single one that actually is fun to play. He feels the games should of taken advice from Contra on how to make a commando theme game more fun.",
