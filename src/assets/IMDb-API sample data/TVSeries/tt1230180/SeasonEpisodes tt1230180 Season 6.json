Starting with Jaws for the NES, which the Nerd complains that the concept is boring when all you do is collect sea shells in order to get power ups that'll allow you to kill the shark quicker. The second game he reviews is Hook for the NES, which is sadly a poorly executed plat-former game resembling nothing like the movie. The Nerd then reviews several Jurassic Park games that are either appealing to play or are contain annoying concepts. Out of all of them, the Nerd regards the 3DO version to be...",

The Nerd reviews the game and already finds the title to be misleading when the main character looks nothing like the one on the cartridge cover and it's no where close to being \"cool\". The Nerd's main complaint is the jumping controls aren't that responsive and random placements of hidden item blocks which creates a hazard when trying to jump to another area or trying to jump on enemies.",

The only NES game the Nerd doesn't own, because it is so rare that authentic copies of the game cost at least $10,000. The game included in the auction deal however was not a legit copy, but just a reproduced edition that is more common to obtain. When all else fails, Nerd contacts a fellow gamer named Pat the NES Punk for a trade in between his box of games for Pat's own NWC game. Upon Pat's observing of the box of game, he find an ...",

The most amusing thing about the game is that the Nerd is able to do a word search on the Bible and discovered there's a lot of A-words in various bible verses. While the most obscured game he reviews for this review is a game called 6 in 1. Which is ...",
