      "content": "Ah yes, what can we say about The Angry Video Game Nerd? Aside from having a nerdy shirt and a pocket pouch, James Rolfe is the star of one of the funniest shows a lot of us has ever seen. Everything about the show is hilarious whether it be the words he makes up to describe how much he hates the games he plays, or to see him take out his rage on the game by destroying it after he is done with it etc. Another reason why the show is so great is because of all the neat special effects that James does, and he does one hell of an awesome job. The theme song is catchy and funny too. I applaud him for all the work he puts into his show to entertain his fans. Great job James, your show is excellent."

The Angry Video Game Nerd is THE best internet show ever made. My personal favorite is the Bible Games episode, that was so funny. At the moment I am waiting for my Angry Nerd DVD I ordered yesterday (June 16th, 2008). I love this show. I mean, James Rolfe is so creative. He can make anyone laugh. Though it's meant for older viewers, for both nostalgia and curse words, kids and teens love it also just for being awesome. It's weird to think that I found out about this show in 2006 by mistake, but, that's the same with every show, right? Anyway check out the show, you won't be disappointed. Anyway, I hope this was helpful."

The channel is Cinemassacre, that's where the AVGN episodes are at. His biggest enemy is LJN (the worst game company). My question is why when Nintendo is around when there's a movie LJN have to make it? This is worth watching and I hope someday he review BatMan Dark Tomorrow (more like BatMan Dank Tomorrow). This is the best video game critic in my opinion."

      "content": "If you haven't seen the outrageous antics of, as the memorable theme song denounces, \"the angriest gamer you've ever heard,\" then you've fallen way too far off of the radar. On a quest to permanently rape and pillage all of the \"shitty games\" in his path, the Nerd also happens to be a comic genius, which makes for a fantastic amalgam of crap, and laughing about crap. What at first may come across as a simple usage of cuss words and toilet humor will quickly have you laughing so hard you'd wished you'd never heard of him in the first place... No wait... That's BS... The games are bad, the between-the-lines references are cool, and a plethora of pop-culture characters and always riveting special effects littered throughout each and every episode will have you wishing that you'd owned some of these atrocious Nintendo (and other console) titles so you could laugh even more. The series is so damn perfect and original, that it's been copied and imitated (never topped by far) by countless individuals (it makes me so damn... Irate... That many of these imitators give him no credit...) Unless you're as tightly wound as an anime turd, you will enjoy AVGN. You don't have to be a gamer to connect with your inner child, which is essentially the effect that the show has, which, I might add, it pulls off extremely well. So put that game controller down, sit back, and watch keenly as James Rolfe takes you back to the past, to examine the ultimate travesties of the video game market."

In this show, he combines both of them and makes extremely well written video game reviews. These games are mostly from the 70s, 80s and 90s. This appeals to me and it gives the show a nice, retro vibe. It is clever how all the episodes intertwine with each other. And above all, IT'S SO FUNNY!!! I can't think of an episode where I didn't laugh. He takes the bad elements of the video games and pokes fun at them and rants about them in ways that make you laugh and also think \"That's a good point. This game does suck.\" Never before have I seen a web-series do this. Over all, The Angry Video Game Nerd is one of my top two favorite series's on YouTube. Perfection!"

It's very funny, and you can watch all episodes for free on the internet, so check it out!"

      "title": "Video Exterminator",
      "content": "To me the strangest thing about technology is the sub culture it produces. Who'd of thought the underground sub culture amateur films and web series would actually come this far today; which just further proves that you can still create good and great things no matter your limitations. This show was one of the first that to me helped pave that way.It's such a simple idea but that's why it's so great and has grown and is still is going to this day, heck there's even going to be a movie about this hopefully it's great. The show is basically like MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) just as they take a lot of bad B movies and make mockery jokes on them, this show does it to video games.James Rolfe is just great, he's kinda playing himself but at the same time slightly contrary due to some of his exaggerated nature. And that's the point he's not a guy meant to be taken seriously; he's almost like a radio shock jock the things he spews out are just really hilarious from the amount of anger, frustrations, and colorful profanity he spews it's both jaw dropping and also just plain funny. But mainly why the humor works is the mere fact that's it's funny because it's true. Yeah there are some visual humor gags which are funny and help reinforce James comedy but really for me it's the verbal humor and James performance that drives this series.I wouldn't say every game he played is really as bad as he makes it, one or two I actually liked (I said one or two). But most of the games he's review are yeah really really bad and sadly I've been unfortunate to play a few of them myself (but don't own for the record thank god or should I say thank me.). Who hasn't felt that disappointment whenever you've rented a game at the video store and you had high hopes this game would blow your mind, only to simply dash your hopes like yesterday's news.James in a way kind of represents our voice on what we were thinking and feeling at the time we might have played one of the games he selected. Though to me the ones that he picks the most or that I've always like were on licensed video games (games based on movies) which I agree always seemed to be the ones that disappointed the most. I can never entirely understand why the heck it is so hard to make a game based on a movie actually good let alone work at all. Mainly because they were made for all the wrong reasons, just simply not made with care or effort at all. Whatever the real reason we'll never know, all I can say is if James or you've played a bad one then it's best to stick to the real deal the movie itself.Some of my favorite have been now doubt the \"Top Gun\" game which was just hilarious seeing how he's just struggling to land the sucker, yeah I've played that game I couldn't land the sucker either. His segment on Atari Porn games, I still wonder what in the hell they were thinking back then. And my favorite one was the recent \"Toxic Crusaders\" episode because it had Lloyd Kalfman in it, just seeing him in that episode I thought was a dream come true and yes on further note I really like the first and forth \"Toxic Avenger\" movies. I just really love the back and forth between both James and Lloyd most of it was actually unscripted, and I really had a feeling that both were having fun together, which made the episode all the more fun and hilarious for me.Well that's all I can say, if you've played a bad video game then \"The Angry Video Game Nerd\" will be there.Rating: 4 stars"

Also in the more recent Game Glitches episode I was almost running out of air when Clubber Lang in the Rocky Game completely glitched. AVGN is one of my inspirations. He is one of the funniest guys you'll ever find on the internet. There is a little nerd in all of us."

All while swearing and making obscene gestures.What I love about him, is that he can just make me laugh at the weird facial expressions he makes. A recent episode has him look in shock as he dies less then a second in the second game of Action 52. Another has him look confused and angry at a Pac man screen as a glictch shows it as... well, let's just say a mean way of saying homosexual.Rolfe also does very entertaining movie reviews, some from the thirtys and some from today. He's great, check him out."

He has made over many videos and gain millions of fans that fell in love of his anger. To this day, he continues to make reviews on games, which bring laughter to us all. My favorite episode would be the Ghostbusters NES game, I never knew that there was one for the NES, but now I do and I know it sucks. So with that said, James Rolfe, I salute you.P.S. Superman N64 was nothing but a PIECE OF DOG CRAP!"

      "content": "The reviewing of poor media products on the internet has become a whole genre of comedy in itself. Movies, video games, anime, comic books, music, etc, all have dedicated reviewers who will pick them apart and criticize all in the good name of entertainment. One of the most famous perpetrators and originators of this genre within the cyberspace of the internet is none other than The Angry Video Game Nerd. The Nerd (James D. Rolfe), is a fouled mouthed, short tempered retro gamer, destined to review as he would call them, \"sh***y f**king games\".The Nerd's trademark humor is comprised mostly of strong profanity and over the top comparisons to describe how awful a game is, i.e. \"This game is so hard it would actually be easier to outside in a thunderstorm and dodge rain\". It's an acquired taste but trust me when I say there are few times in my life in which I laughed as hard when I first discovered this guy and watched his Ghostbusters review back in 2007.This is partially due to many of the games he reviews being so horrific they almost review themselves but also because of James' charisma as a performer. Let's face it, almost everyone who goes on the internet and makes videos in which they try to entertain or inform (including top subscribed You Tubers, although I won't name names) are ether dull or are trying to force a personality onto themselves. James on the other hand is just a complete natural. He's always an absolute joy to listen to and makes the art of appearing on camera and reviewing media (whether comically or straight) seem easy. However James is first and foremost a film maker and thanks to this The Angry Video Game Nerd had considerably greater production values than most other internet content. Frankly the guy is one of my personal heroes. I still continue to enjoy new episodes of The Angry Video Game Nerd. I'm glad James now only makes several episodes per year, whereas at the height of the series productivity we had two every month. Some of the more recent episodes are among some of the funniest he's ever done, not bad for something which debuted on YouTube 9 years ago. I just hope he will keep the character in this state of semi retirement. With The Angry Video Game Nerd, James Rolfe managed to create something totally original. Countless imitators will come and go but the original will never be topped."

I owned an Atari 2600, Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Nintendo 64, Gameboy, Playstation, Playstation 2, Gamecube, Xbox, Xbox 360, Nintendo WII, PS3, Nintendo DS, PSP, Nintendo 3Ds...so yeah, it is safe to assume I enjoy video games. I also enjoy watching people riff on bad things such as movies, hence my love for the show MST3K. Well this one features a man known as the Angry Video Game Nerd and he basically slices and dices video games of the past. I find the show hilarious and find myself agreeing with him on a lot of his points. Granted, I do not think that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is as bad as he claims, nor do I find Castlevania II bad, but I usually tend to agree with him. Not that you have to agree with him to find the show funny, the guy had me laughing hysterically during his episode where he revisited Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and talked about how the birds pooped on you. Suffice to say he is extremely vulgar, most certainly not for the kids. Though I find it hysterical that he did not censor himself at all while he babysat the kids in episode where he reviewed the game Halloween for the Atari 2600. I have seen plenty of people try to imitate him, probably saw them before the angry video game nerd, but they just do not get it. He is not simply a guy reviewing games and being humorous, he is a tortured soul trying to warn us and educate us on bad video games. Ironically, we probably end up buying a lot of the games he reviews wanting to experience the nightmare ourselves! However, played Friday the 13th when I was younger and it was a horrible game. Watching his review brought back the memories of how bad as I had forgotten the hellish cavern and forest parts of the game and the completely messed up sense of direction. Many times he has the same feelings I experienced as a kid playing a game for the first time. Like Ghostbusters, I too loved the movie and when I played the game I was completely and utterly disappointed by it. I also had the hardest time with that jump on ninja turtles and was stunned when I learned you simply walked over it. Not only does he review games, but he often times puts on a funny skit type thing like when he was captured by the leatherface clan. Kind of sad that a guy can randomly make a show on the web that is funnier than all the sitcoms on television."

      "content": "While the series has a few flaws , they are very minor. The series is about The AVGN , a nerd who reviews awful games (on some occasions good games) and while not meant to be taken seriously , it's somehow more trustable than today's game journalists (IGN , Polygon , Kotaku , Common Sense Media)."

      "content": "The good: Catchy theme song, great character, great comedy. The bad: I get stomach cramps hearing what the nerd would rather do. Ew.If you have never heard of the nerd, you are a deprived individual. This Internet series is just great. It's hilarious, original, and more entertaining than most big-budget TV comedies. James Rolfe is a great actor/producer/director and Mike Matei gets absolutely immersed in his roles, which include Mike Myers, Jason, The Joker, and Bugs Bunny.Every new episode gets better, every one is hilarious. I would love to hear James doing a big budget film. Talent like his is hard to find.Bottom Line: My favorite show. Ever. Excellent"

      "title": "The Angry Video Game Nerd",
      "content": "I couldn't think of a good enough title to summarize how creative and hilarious this series is. Sure its on the internet, but James Rolfe has shown the creativity that is still within the minds of some filmmakers out there who should be making the movies, unlike most directors we see today. James had no intention of becoming as big as he did, but with an idea like this, he deserved to. We follow the adventures of the Nerd(played by James) as he re-lives the games from back in the day that have tormented him for over 20 years. With his constant swearing, violent acts occasionally, and great in depth analysis of the games he plays, The Nerd keeps you laughing through an entire episode. Somethings about the show that are better than 90% of TV today are:1)The Writing 2)The THEME SONG 3)and The NerdIf you'V heard of this before on the internet, you should definitely check it out, because it has to be one of the best ideas that has come across us in a while."

      "content": "He's gonna take you back to the past to play those crazy games that suck ads. He'd rather have a buffalo take some ultra-bluesy stuff in his ear. He'd rather eat the rotten meat-hole of a redneck horse and down it with tears. He's the angriest gamer you've ever heard. He's the Angry Nintendo Nerd. He's the Angry Atari Sega Nerd. He's the Angry Video Game Nerd. When he turns on his TV, Make sure it's tuned to Channel 3. He's got an awesome shirt and a pocket pouch, although I've never seen him write anything down. He's got a Power Glove and a filthy mouth. Armed with his Zapper, he will tear these games down. He's the angriest gamer you've ever heard. He's the Angry Nintendo Nerd. He's the Angry Atari Sega Nerd. He's the Angry Video Game Nerd. He's close to barf all over his feet while playing stuff that no one can beat. He just can't take it anymore, Although he won't stop 'till he's past Level 4. With his Power Glove and his Zapper Gun, he's trying hard, but then again it's no fun. He's the angriest gamer you've ever heard. He's the Angry Nintendo Nerd. He's the Angry Atari Sega Nerd. He's the Angry Video Game Nerd. He plays the worst games of all time, They're terrible abominations of mankind. They make him so mad, he could spit or say \"Cowabunga?\" Cowafreakin' piece of dog spit! They rip you off and don't care one bit, But the Nerd, he doesn't ever forget. He'd rather fight a insane shark before he takes more animals to the ark. His list is long, with many names, What were they thinking when they made all these games!? He's the Angry Nintendo Nerd. He's the Angry Atari Sega Nerd. He's the Angry Video Game Nerd. He asks stuff that do not make sense. And he knows about the gaming defense. Why can't a turtle swim? Why can't I land a plane? They got a quick buck for this spit-load of duck!? The characters' names are wrong! Why's the password so long!? Why don't the weapons do anything!? He's the angriest gamer you've ever heard, If you like him, you must buy his new shirt, The game sucks so bad, he makes up his own words. He's the angriest, most messed-up gaming nerd. He's the angry console gaming nerd. He's the angry Atari Amiga CD-I Colecovision Intellivision Sega Neo-Geo Turbografx-16 Odyssey 3DO Commodore Nintendo Nerd. He's the Angry Video Game... Nerd.So, that's my longest AVGN review. Also, I give a 10/10. :)"

      "title": "Best Retro Gaming show on the Net",
      "content": "The Angry Video Game Nerd is an original concept created by James Rolfe. A show that picks out flaws of old retro games that many children of the 70, 80's and early 90's grew up with.I've personally been following this show since he started on Youtube. And continued on to make the jump to Gametrailers when his show got picked up.It impresses me how this show just continues to get better and more entertaining. If you go back and look at some of the earlier episodes, its easy to tell how much better the show has become. The latest videos of 2009 have been some of his most well done yet. Michael Jacksons Moonwalker video was a riot.There have been quite a few people who have tried to emulate his style and brand of humor. But these other imitators seem to die off pretty quick. There's a reason why he's the best out there. And that's because he created this genre. That's why he is (and will always be) the best at it.If you haven't yet seen this show, I HIGHLY recommend getting yourself over to Gametrailers to check it out. In my opinion, funniest, most original show on the web. I just wish they'd come out more often"

      "title": "Hilarious to the nth degree!",
      "content": "James Rolfe as the titular nerd is hilarious. His foul-mouthed rants about bad (and sometimes good games), catchy theme song, his sense of humor and wordplay and his attire make him recognizable and fun to watch. Basically the premise of his show is just the Nerd reviewing bad games and making fun of their obviously noticeable flaws such as Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest and the NES' The Terminator from faulty controls, grammatically incorrect translations to near impossible designs and levels. It's also funny how as a reoccurring gag he bashes an out of business publishing company LJN for many of the games he reviews.Personally my favorite episodes are the ones where he reviews the CDI Zelda and Hotel Mario games much to his frustration upon playing them. He highlights the problems while also explaining the history behind them as well. Some of the good games he's reviewed are Super Mario Bros 3, Ghosts and Goblins, Ninja Gaiden and Metal Gear which also have noticeable aforementioned flaws. The only one that doesn't fall under that category is Ninja Baseball Batman which's an obscure arcade game to the west.If you like in your face exaggerations of everyday things then this's for you but if you like subtle less sweary comedy, you might want to skip it. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself."
