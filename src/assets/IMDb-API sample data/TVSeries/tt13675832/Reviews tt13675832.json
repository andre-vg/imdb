      "content": "Writing a review on a dominantly English-speaking website about a Turkish show would seem like complete loss of time, but I will write a couple of sentences to potentially draw some interest from the non-Turkish watchers to this show.Gibi (as if) is a sit-com, largely exploring themes that have very low probability to happen but also not impossible, which involves two (then three) close friends. Lead, Yilmaz, would potentially win all angry people's hearts with his usually accurate but constant realism and cynicism. Usually episodes open up in a singular theme, moves characters around that and their own take on it and very likely heading towards a rollercoaster of events (and sometimes emotions) with a grand result. Episodes are largely unlinked with each other so there is no need to watch in sequence.There is certainly a Turkish cultural filter requirement, but some of the themes are also universal. I'd say, in the first season #3 and #4, #6, #7 and #8 are largely exploring areas that can resonate almost globally. Without spoilers, think about how would the entire family would react, if grandpa decides to become a nude model for a local art school?Second season is even bolder to some extent, looking into comedic but also cautionary tales about bdsm, cosplaying for simping, attending the wedding of childhood sweethearts and the fall of Rome.I think the international success of the show, if it ever happens, will largely depend on availability in an international streaming service with significantly improved English substitles. But a short term experimentation could happen with releasing a couple of episodes online free (again with much better Eng subs) for broader audiences.I think, at heart, this show is for observing the characters (and sometimes yourself) in a largely unlikely but possible events with usually comedic outcomes. Others have also said, if you like Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasim, this is for you, in a different language and sometimes culture, but largely in a similar context and flavour."

      "content": "If I interpret it as an intense comedy watcher and compare the vibe it gives, it resembles a British Peep Show sitcom in terms of characters and events. In fact, the 3 main characters, who are very ordinary but equally unique, create comedy by catalyzing each other in the absurd events that happen to them. Although their natural, understated and low-mimic acting is considered by some as bad acting, it makes me feel more involved in the events. The guest actors in the series, on the other hand, create a contrast with their more colorful, absurd and exaggerated acting. The lack of a connection between the episodes of the series is nice on the one hand, but on the other hand, it creates a roller coaster as a performance. A few stagnant episodes that come after a great episode can distract people from the series. Nevertheless, I congratulate the writers and the series will find itself even more in the following seasons and clinch its place among Turkish cult comedy series."
