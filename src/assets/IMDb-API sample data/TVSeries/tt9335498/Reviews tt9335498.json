      "content": "Demon Slayer Season 1 (2019) is a series my daughter and I recently watched on Netflix (26 episodes). The storyline focuses on a family that lives on a mountain üèî just outside of town where everyone in the family plays a roll for their survival. The sons job is to walk into town, trade for supplies and bring them home for his family. One day he returns home and finds his entire family has been murdered by demons on the mountain. So begins his journey to become a demon slayer...aided by his sister turned demon herself and friends he encounters along the way. The gore in this was better than I anticipated and the creatures are portrayed awesome - Many unique demons with surprisingly cool powers. I loved the evolution of the main characters as well as the friends he meets and their display of powers. The animation is very good. My daughter loved the storyline and can't wait to watch the movie. The only annoying part is the persistent inner monologue, but what anime series doesn't have an abundance of that? I'd score this a 9-9.5/10 and strongly recommend this."

I admit, the storyline of demon slayer isn't anything new, some people say it's an overrated show, some say it's cliche...and that's ok...why???...because every single person is entitled to their own opinion...the criticisms might be true but I will say this...there's a reason why this anime is so popular and there's a reason why so many people not only in Japan but around the world enjoy it. Not every single anime or TV show has to have a plot twist of a story like attack on titan or Vinland saga, as long as its entertaining and enjoyable for everyone to enjoy then really thats all that matters. Demon slayer is a good show and I would highly recommend it to anyone especially people who aren't anime watchers, it's incredible."

      "content": "I have seen a lot of action fantasy anime shows, but for some reason, this is the best. I was so into it that I can't pick one just thing as my favorite about this show. The action, the character development, the emotional moments, the score, the animation or be it just the writing in general, Demon Slayer is on a whole different level. I went through a number of emotions watching it, and it felt like I was on one wild ride from episode 1 to 26. The mood keeps varying from time to time, but the tempo never drops and with intriguing characters, it only gets better and better with every episode.Demon Slayer keeps shifting focus to different supporting characters, thus making you feel as if you're yourself a part of the protagonist Tanjiro's journey: one filled with tons of mind-blowing, jaw-dropping action sequences. There were a number of moments where my mind was blown away! Amidst all the violence and tension, the sweet brother-sister relationship of Tanjiro and Nezuko tugs at your heartstrings. While Tanjiro is the usual memorable and relatable \"shonen\" protagonist, other characters are surprisingly also treated very well. Be it the cute Nezuko, the tough yet hilarious Inosuke, or the comic relief yet strongly written Zenitsu, the show is full of characters that will end up growing on you.The animation is literally breathtaking. Several action scenes feel like actually filmed with a camera than drawn by hand, which is stupendous! The score is another major positive, elevating the show's epic scale and tone to unexpected levels. Although it's not a comedy, the funny bits involving the three boys are a major highlight, especially in the last few episodes. Some might find its quickly shifting focus from one set of supporting characters to another a little uneven, but the writing is so strong you don't get time to think anything else, with constant action delivered in every episode.I am normally left blank when I finish watching an anime show, but that's not what happened here. I was instead happy that it was perfectly concluded and it left me excited for the box-office blockbuster sequel film, which I clearly can't wait to watch now. Demon Slayer is the best anime I've seen to date, and something I'd love to watch again and again."

Tanjiro our protaganist is unlike many other shonen anime protaganists (one piece: Luffy for example) while Luffy's goal is to become the pirate king, tanjiros goal does not base itself in his growth. It is his will and moral of saving others and furfilling his quest of helping his sister that drives him forward which means that gaining strengh is not the primarily focus which for me adds a new perspective to the show. If you have seen up until episode 19 and you have not rated this show, There really is no convincing you. This show is a masterpiece and you'll be hooked from the first episode!"

      "title": "The success of Demon Slayer's first season was visually present all throughout the series, but was steps away from being truly outstanding all around.",
      "content": "Put simply, the best and most praiseworthy aspects of the series were its design, art style, and animation, while some of the characters and the story writing could've used some polishing.It isn't hard to see why Demon Slayer is very well received, because that is exactly what the series excelled at: its visual design and action sequences. From its very first episode to the last, Demon Slayer never fails in this department, delivering a clean and appealing animation style when it is focused on the main storyline of Tanjiro and Nezuko Kamado's journey.It is when other characters enter as the story progresses that the series starts to show its flaws. For the most part, characters beside Tanjiro and Nezuko have their own charm and are able to fulfill their roles well. However, there are also characters who haven't been fleshed out enough to leave a strong impression before the story moves on to its next part. Even the backstories for these characters seemed half-baked, and are only there for the purpose of giving the viewers some sort of understanding to the characters and a shallow attempt at obtaining sympathy for them. The strong traits displayed by some overbearing characters cannot be downplayed by how irritating their personalities can be, which is probably turned up for comedy even if it isn't at all funny, especially when the mood changes from fun to serious. You'll often find tropes like these in other series in the same vein, just done smoother.There are a lot more anime series out there that have done better at developing a story in the course of fewer episodes than in the first season of Demon Slayer. Parts that are made to be funny at times come out as obnoxious and uninteresting, and the story writing leaves a lot to be desired with several parts condensed in 26 episodes, compromising its build-ups and character depth for the thrill of the hunt.Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has a lot of potential. It has lived up to the hype for the elements it is praised for, namely design and animation, but delivers an underwritten story which could have made this anime series superior to its peers in the adventure and fantasy genres had it been given just as much attention the design and animation got."
