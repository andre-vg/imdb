Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network described the first two episodes of the anime adaptation, saying, \"It's hard to say what kind of show Titan would be without the operatic over-direction of Tetsuro Araki, but with him in charge, it's a clenched fist of a series: always tensed up to strike and prone to bludgeoning us when it does.\" Other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it \"is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals,\" and \"an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next.\" Carlo Santos noted that \"few get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does\". Santos described it as \"a masterpiece of death and destruction\" after watching only the first episode. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the \"intense, impactful first episode\" despite his feeling that it has \"limited animation\". Martin also compared Attack on Titan's vibe and visual aesthetic to Claymore.\r\nJohn Sinnott of DVD Talk called the series one of the best ones he has ever watched and one \"that anime fans should not miss\". Maya Phillips of New York magazine and Vulture praised the uniqueness of the series, stating, \"In our current age of terrifying dystopian realities, it's hard to find a dystopian show with something new to deliver - and yet here it is.\" Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian, he praised the animation of the series as \"spellbinding... It's all wonderfully acrobatic and intense\". Regarding the climactic episodes of the third season's second half, Manga.Tokyo called Isayama a \"genius\" for using the revelations about Grisha's past to smoothly link present events to the beginning of the story.\r\nCrunchyroll listed Attack on Titan in their \"Top 25 best anime of the 2010s\". IGN and Polygon also listed Attack on Titan among the best anime series of the 2010s. Lauren Orsini of Forbes included Attack on Titan on her list of the best anime of the decade.\r\nCensorship\r\n: In 2015, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China forbade distribution of \"Attack on Titan,\" along with 38 other anime and manga titles, which were deemed to feature scenes of violence, pornography, terrorism and crimes against public morality, in an effort to \"protect the healthy development of youth\".\r\n: As part of Malaysia's censorship laws, it is required that parts of bodies which are considered indecent be censored. In Attack on Titan, the corpse of the Titan can be seen wearing a bodysuit.\r\n: In July 2021, the government of the Russian Federation banned the distribution of Attack on Titan among various other titles citing “concern for the welfare of youth.” In the wake of the military invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, the series distributor Crunchyroll shut down its subsidiaries of Wakanim and Crunchyroll EMEA in the country, due to international sanctions thus preventing Russian viewers from legally streaming Attack on Titan.\r\nViewership\r\nIn 2021, during the first part of the final season, Attack on Titan was the most viewed television program in the United States, before it was overtaken by The Falcon and the Winter Soldier shortly before the mid-season finale. Attack on Titan broke the Guinness World Record for the \"most in-demand anime TV show\". The show is also the only anime series to be in TV Time's top 50 most followed TV series ever, currently at number 47, making it one of the few Non-American titles and the only Japanese title in this list. In 2022 Attack on Titan won the award of \"Most in-demand TV series in the world 2021\" in the Global TV Demand Awards. Attack on Titan became the first ever non-English language series to earn the title of World’s Most In-Demand TV Show, previously held by only The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.\r\nAwards and nominations",

It won the 2013 Digital Contents of the Year Award at Japan's 19th annual Association of Media in Digital (AMD) Awards.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the show an overall score of 95%. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network described the first two episodes of the anime adaptation, saying, \"It's hard to say what kind of show Titan would be without the operatic over-direction of Tetsuro Araki, but with him in charge, it's a clenched fist of a series: always tensed up to strike and prone to bludgeoning us when it does.\" Other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it \"is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals,\" and \"an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next.\" Carlo Santos noted that \"few get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does\". Santos described it as \"a masterpiece of death and destruction\" after watching only the first episode. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the \"intense, impactful first episode\" despite his feeling that it has \"limited animation\". Martin also compared Attack on Titan's vibe and visual aesthetic to Claymore.</p><p>John Sinnott of DVD Talk called the series one of the best ones he has ever watched and one \"that anime fans should not miss\". Maya Phillips of New York magazine and Vulture praised the uniqueness of the series, stating, \"In our current age of terrifying dystopian realities, it's hard to find a dystopian show with something new to deliver - and yet here it is.\" Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian, he praised the animation of the series as \"spellbinding... It's all wonderfully acrobatic and intense\". Regarding the climactic episodes of the third season's second half, Manga.Tokyo called Isayama a \"genius\" for using the revelations about Grisha's past to smoothly link present events to the beginning of the story.</p><p>Crunchyroll listed Attack on Titan in their \"Top 25 best anime of the 2010s\". IGN and Polygon also listed Attack on Titan among the best anime series of the 2010s. Lauren Orsini of Forbes included Attack on Titan on her list of the best anime of the decade.</p><h4>Censorship</h4><ul><li>: In 2015, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China forbade distribution of \"Attack on Titan,\" along with 38 other anime and manga titles, which were deemed to feature scenes of violence, pornography, terrorism and crimes against public morality, in an effort to \"protect the healthy development of youth\".</li><li>: As part of Malaysia's censorship laws, it is required that parts of bodies which are considered indecent be censored. In Attack on Titan, the corpse of the Titan can be seen wearing a bodysuit.</li><li>: In July 2021, the government of the Russian Federation banned the distribution of Attack on Titan among various other titles citing “concern for the welfare of youth.” In the wake of the military invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, the series distributor Crunchyroll shut down its subsidiaries of Wakanim and Crunchyroll EMEA in the country, due to international sanctions thus preventing Russian viewers from legally streaming Attack on Titan.</li></ul><h4>Viewership</h4><p>In 2021, during the first part of the final season, Attack on Titan was the most viewed television program in the United States, before it was overtaken by The Falcon and the Winter Soldier shortly before the mid-season finale. Attack on Titan broke the Guinness World Record for the \"most in-demand anime TV show\". The show is also the only anime series to be in TV Time's top 50 most followed TV series ever, currently at number 47, making it one of the few Non-American titles and the only Japanese title in this list. In 2022 Attack on Titan won the award of \"Most in-demand TV series in the world 2021\" in the Global TV Demand Awards. Attack on Titan became the first ever non-English language series to earn the title of World’s Most In-Demand TV Show, previously held by only The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.</p><br/><h3>Awards and nominations</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><caption></caption><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Year</th><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"References\">Ref.</abbr></th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"27\">2013</td><td rowspan=\"13\">3rd <span>Newtype Anime Awards</span></td><td>Best Work (TV)</td><td><i>Attack on Titan</i></td><td style=\"background: #9EFF9E;
