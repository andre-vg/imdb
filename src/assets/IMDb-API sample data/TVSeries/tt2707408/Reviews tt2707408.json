I found Narcos akin to The Wire in terms of doing honor to the subject matter in a multi-layered way.It's a gritty show and unlike The Wire, it's more true crime/fact-based. The show gives fascinating insights into the inner workings of drug/crime syndicates and the level of risk people will take to transport them across borders and into other countries. It tells of the brutality of drug lords and the lengths they'll go to make profit. The acting, cinematography and script are first class."

It also follows other drug cartels throughout the years and how they do business. It's about real life events which they execute almost perfectly. Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar especially is just incredible. He resembles Pablo Escobar as good as any actor has ever tried. Almost half the show is in Spanish but you get used the subtitles and forget about them pretty quickly. Once you start watching this you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. It's that good!"

Instantly I jumped onto Netflix and I was not disappointed. This is a truly gripping show, one of the best I've seen this year. The characters and acting are done well and the storyline moves at a fast enough pace to get your adrenalin pumping for the whole episode. My only fear was that it would be too generic of a Crime drama, but those feelings were quickly swept away. This is truly an original and thoroughly planned out TV show with a whole lot of heart. Maybe the best on Netflix at the moment. Narco doesn't disappoint with any aspect of the show. It's exciting and fast paced, but above all, it makes you want to keep coming back for more."

I admit though, this wouldn't have been as impactful if not for the phenomenal supporting cast!In terms of Audio, Visuals, Acting, this Series is one of the best.Just remember, that this Series is not a documentary, so if you want facts you should research it yourself, the antagonist's real life counterpart was far, far more evil than depicted.All in all, it's a good watch that shows how sickening mankind can be when Hope is lost.

Season 1 tells the true story of notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who became a billionaire through the production and distribution of cocaine, while also focusing on Escobar's interactions with drug lords. This is a massive story.Escobar's life has attracted my attention too. I watched many videos and read books about Escobar's life. The show educates you on the Medellin Cartel and it is a very interesting topic to learn about. Pablo Escobar had much more influence on the political system than i would expected. This series has added a lot to me about it. Wagner Moura is an excellent actor and he learned Spanish just for the Pablo Escobar's role. He was born for this role. The bilingual dialogue adds a new layer of authenticity to the project and shows it's commitment with the original story. The long and often complicated story of Pablo Escobar is portrayed simple and effective for viewers not to get lost in what is going on.Congrats to Netflix for such a powerful, incredible production. I would recommend this show to all my friends and anyone looking for a great show to watch. This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. Can't wait for the next season to come out! 10/10"

The first two seasons of the show are amazing and ghe to third season is not as good as the first too but still it's pretty good and entertaining to watch. 30 episodes of non-stop entertainment. I'll definitely recommend jf you are a fan of crime genre, specially based on true events (coz it makes it better). The whole series is based on narco terrorism in Colombia. The first two seasons are Based on \"Medellin Cartel\" whose boss was Pablo Escobar. The third season is based on \"The Cali Cartel\" run by the Rodriguez brothers. That's why I said that the first two season were dope but the third one was amazing too. So, if you haven't already, go watch it."

Netflix is now really starting to compete with HBO and this is much better than Netflix anchor House of Cards for example. Now I don't like shows that glorify and make the criminals heroes, but I don't think this series does that. Escobar is a ruthless person but still his a family man in some ways. Whats good with Narcos is that it portrays both side of the law. If it would only show it from Pablos perspective it wouldn't be as interesting. This is a very classy production. Everything from the DEA-detective who is the narrative voice to the quality of the camera work. The actors are spot on and the scenes are amazing. I nearly feel that I'm in the Colombian jungle and the hot humid air touches me through the screen. I just love series nowadays. You can transport you self to nearly every situation of life and follow character for a long time. And they really use the advantages of series if you compare it to film."

      "content": "This Netflix series charts the rise and fall of the Colombian drug lords as their power increases as they earn billions of US dollars supplying the United States with cocaine and the actions of the DEA as they try to bring them to justice. The first two seasons are centred on Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel and DEA Agents Steve Murphy and Javier PeÃ±a while the third sees PeÃ±a leading the hunt for the 'Gentlemen of Cali', the cartel which eventually took over from Escobar.The story shown is based on reality but the makers never pretend that it is entirely true... a pre-title card informs us that some characters are entirely fictional. That doesn't stop it feeling real thanks to the way events are depicted. The characters are shown in a matter of fact way leaving it to the viewer to judge them... of course given what we see some of them do it isn't hard to condemn many of them. Even so surprisingly few characters are totally unsympathetic at all times. The cast does a really impressive job bringing their characters to life; most obviously Pedro Pascal as Javier PeÃ±a and Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. Many people have commented about incorrect accents but I doubt this will be a problem for non-Spanish speakers; it was certainly better than having all characters speaking English. Overall I found the series really gripping; I'll certainly be watching 'Narcos: Mexico' soon."

Sounds like a t v script, but no it was real. The character arch, acting, sets, directing and the ebb and flow of the series was balanced perfectly. The mixing of the D E A (English parts) and Columbia (Spanish parts) are done well. Regrettably one may get tired or their eyes from reading sub titles. One of those binge watching series. 10 stars. One of the better shows, like Mindhunter, to watch on Netflix."

This area is still a problem for US films in my view and the 'tough, whiskey drinking and not afraid of anyone' character is rather tiring.Anyhow, at least in this film the non US cast get to become the focus, the story.Like all Netflix productions, it uses 3 seasons of episodes when 1 would be enough but there you go.My only warning about watching is when you see the actress playing Escobar's wife, it becomes impossible not to lose yourself in her absolute and stunning beauty.I could not concentrate once she became a regular."

      "content": "At one point in Episode 7 the new president of Colombia says to a group of US officials trying to have him accept more aid to hunt Escobar, \"660 tons of cocaine were consumed in the United States last year. Perhaps if your resources were focused at home we'd all be better off.\"Can I get an Amen? He hits the bullseye. Netflix gives us yet another reason to stay out of the cine multiplex with this slightly fictionalized but excellent new series. It takes most of the pertinent action right out of the history from this sad era of Colombian (and American) history. Filmed entirely on location in Colombia and with a good 50% of the dialogue in Spanish this series aims to be as real as possible. The story also colors way outside the lines of the Manichean version of the Drug War most Americans have swallowed hook, line, and sinker since Uncle Ronnie started feeding it to us back in his presidency.In the role of Pablo Escobar is Wagner Moura who actually had to learn Spanish to play the part. I wish that he would send his Spanish teacher over here to teach me because he speaks it very well. I'm sure native Colombians can tell that he's not one of them but I can't. Besides that he is a dead ringer (pardon the expression) for Pablo.Unflinchingly brutal and set at a desperate pace this is one of the best crime dramas I've seen in a long time. This series reminds me of the two great novels of Don Winslow which chronicle the Mexican cartels, The Power of the Dog and The Cartel. The structure is almost like a documentary in concept with a voice-over by one of the principal DEA agents on the scene. I am only a few episodes into this and already hoping for another seasonâ€”a very high compliment.This series is vastly superior to the Benicio del Toro Escobar film which was pretty awful. Movies can't hold a candle to the best series. There is no way to tell this story in a 90 minute movie. Great job, Netflix!Season 2Is it just me or was Season 2 almost completely in Spanish? Granted, the Spanish they speak was difficult for me to understand at times but I just wonder how most of the American public feels about seeing a series in which they are almost entirely dependent on reading subtitles. I think Americans are getting more and more sophisticated in their tastes and any series in which Pablo Escobar speaks English would just be phony and stupid. I thought the directors relied too much on music montage scenes that just took up a lot of time without adding much to the story. It just seems like an unoriginal clichÃ©. The show worked best when they followed the real historic events of the story and when they delved into pure fiction it was much less compelling.There was way too much of his wife and kids in the second season. I get it; Pablo was a family guy. That doesn't mean you need to have scene after scene of him playing with his kids or talking to his half-wit wife. Why should we care about the family of a monster who blew up airliners and placed horrifically powerful bombs on crowded city streets? We don't. Los Pepes should have killed them all, including his mother. There were much bigger things in the picture that could have been discussed. I loved the CIA guy and his role in the story. He was creepy as well as totally believable for his part. In the end you have to realize that the United States' effort in Colombia amounted to doodly squat. All we really did was to fan a drug war that took the lives of perhaps thousands of people, either guilty of some infraction or completely innocent. The two DEA agents seemed barely competent to do their jobs, whatever their jobs were. At least they alluded to this in the final scene. \"The king is dead; long live the kings!\"S3 Almost binged it and I have to say this Season 3 is the best of the three by far. It's more layered and has better characters. Seasons 1 & 2 had Pablo and I really like the actor but this I never liked the gringo DEA guy much. This story is more complicated as well. I also think they make good use of their time. I love the fact that it's only 10 episodes and we can expect some sort of resolution (I hope so) at the end.Each episode is skillfully crafted to contain a single story and then leave you practically begging for the next installment. Overall this storyline is a lot more interesting than the two previous season involving Pablo Escobar. Who needs Pablo?The violence is chilling to the core because it is handed out sparingly, at least at first. How many people have died so that Americans can use cocaine? Half a million people? More? A lot more?"

The highly cinematic Colombia and the busy urban life makes it visually formidable as well.Netflix used to cater to a more highbrow type of audience, it seems long ago now. But this show felt like a close pproximation of the real world in a very entertaining fashion. Another good thing about \"NARCOS\" is the the fast pace it has to keep the audience engaged. Film lovers who like gangster movies will find this new series gripping. Folks looking out for some action paced crime drama should definitely hang on to this one. First episode will grab your attention to the level that you would want to see all ten episodes at once. Finally we got some gangster stuff to look at in classic settings."

It's simply superb! Not once was I bored, I did not want this to finish, I knew nothing about Pablo's life, but man, what a life he lived. You have to see this to believe it!"

      "content": "(Reviewed after Season 3).The history of the Colombian drug cartels, and the US DEA's efforts to bring them to justice. Seasons 1 and 2 focus on the Medellin Cartel and its infamous leader, Pablo Escobar. Season 3 centres on the successor to the Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel.Superb. Edifying, enthralling and incredibly engaging - compelling viewing. A good mix of history, drama, action and intrigue. Well-drawn and developed characters - even the bad guys have character depth.Shows well the mountain of a task that faced the DEA in bringing Colombia's cocaine manufacturers to justice, as even the local police and politicians couldn't be trusted.Adding to the authenticity is that about 80% of the dialogue is in Spanish. No Colombians speaking English to each other in a Spanish accent. (There are English sub-titles, of course, should you want them).Brilliant performance by Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. He absolutely inhabits the role, making Escobar seem like an average guy, complete with personal mannerisms and traits. Makes for a very engaging and empathetic experience. If it wasn't for the fact that Escobar was a mass-murderer, he might even be likeable... (Interesting fact: Moura is Brazilian and had to learn Spanish for the role. Makes me even more impressed with his performance and work-ethic).The negative aspect to Seasons 1 and 2 was the character of DEA agent Steve Murphy, played by Boyd Holbrook. He did not seem that an important enough character to be the narrator and essentially central figure of Seasons 1 and 2. Moreover, he is a tad irritating and Holbrook's performance involves talking low and slurred, which is how actors talk nowadays when they want to try to win awards, probably because they think people might mistake them for Marlon Brando.Pedro Pascal (who might be familiar to Game of Thrones viewers, as he played Oberyn Martell in Season 4) puts in a solid performance as Agent Javier Pena. His character grows in importance as the series progresses and he really steps up as the progression occurs. In Season 3 he takes over narration and does a much better job than Boyd Holbrook.On that note, I was a bit apprehensive about Season 3. When the Pablo Escobar story ended, I felt that this was a natural end to the series. Everything had been building up to Escobar's demise and by the time it came, I was drained, the build-up of tension was so great. Plus Wagner Moura had made him into such a larger-than-life and engaging character, replacing that character would be difficult.However, the writers do a great job in Season 3 of maintaining the engagement, through showing several characters, good, bad and neutral, and how the events affect them, plus making the plot development incredibly nail-biting.Fantastic series."

      "content": "As a native Colombian, born and raised in Medellin (in 1975) and victim myself of the Pablo Escobar era, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised with the show!!! I thought it was going to be another bad gringo movie about Colombia with lots of mistakes and not even Colombian landscapes in the background but, I WAS WRONG!!!! Very good actors too, I didn't like Escobar accent since it's not real Paisa accent but it's OK; it will go unnoticed to non- native Colombians ;)Good Job Netflix!!
