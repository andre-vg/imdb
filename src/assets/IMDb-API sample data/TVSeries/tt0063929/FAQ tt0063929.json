      "question": "Why is my favourite Python sketch not here?",
      "answer": "If you mean The Four Yorkshireman sketch, this was an At Last The 1948 Show which was on The Secret Policeman's Ball. If you mean the Michelangelo sketch, this was banned from this show but appeared on The Secret Policeman's Ball. Or it could be a sketch from Meaning of Life. Else it must be another show featuring them (such as Do Not Adjust Your Set or The Frost Report) which you have confused with Python."
