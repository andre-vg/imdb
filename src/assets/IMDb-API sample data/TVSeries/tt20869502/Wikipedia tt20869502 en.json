It received audience acclaim, with its final episode recording 17.5% nationwide ratings, making it the eighth highest-rated drama in Korean cable television history and seventh highest-rated television drama by number of viewers.\r\nSynopsis\r\nExtraordinary Attorney Woo tells the story of Woo Young-woo, an autistic lawyer who is raised by her single father. She grows up with one friend at school, Dong Geu-ra-mi, an oddball girl who protects her from school bullies. She graduates at the top of her law school class at Seoul National University. Because she's autistic, no one will hire her. However, through a connection of her father's, she obtains her first job at Hanbada, a large Seoul law firm. Attorney Woo's intelligence and photographic memory help her to become an excellent lawyer, as she is able to recall laws and everything she reads, sees, or hears perfectly.\r\nBeing different from neurotypical peers, her manner of communication is initially seen as odd and awkward, and her strong emotional intelligence remains unrecognized. But as the series progresses, many of the people she meets, such as her supervising lawyer, Jung Myung-seok, her law school classmate and peer, Choi Su-yeon, and legal support staffer Lee Jun-ho adjust to her as she learns her craft as a rookie attorney. But she also encounters people who are prejudiced against her and others with disabilities, including her fellow colleague Kwon Min-woo, who often tries to sabotage her.\r\nMany of the legal cases in the series involve finely balanced legal issues and sometimes difficult ethical questions. Attorney Woo's approach is often unique and helps resolve cases in unexpected ways. One storyline about Young-woo's parents runs through the series and involves the rivalry between two major law firms, both chaired by female attorneys, Han Seon-young, CEO of Hanbada, and Tae Soo-mi, CEO of Taesan.\r\nAnother theme that runs through the series is Young-woo's strong interest in whales and other marine mammals. Her tendency to analogize situations she faces in her professional and private life with the lives and characteristics of whales and dolphins often surprises and confounds the people who surround her. Her eureka moments often coincide with fantasizing about marine animals.\r\nCast and characters\r\nMain\r\nPark Eun-bin as Woo Young-wooOh Ji-yul as young Woo Young-woo\r\nOh Ji-yul as young Woo Young-woo\r\nKang Tae-oh as Lee Jun-ho\r\nKang Ki-young as Jung Myung-seok\r\nSupporting\r\nJeon Bae-soo as Woo Gwang-hoJang Seong-beom as young Gwang-ho\r\nJang Seong-beom as young Gwang-ho\r\nBaek Ji-won as Han Seon-young\r\nJin Kyung as Tae Soo-miJung Han-bit as young Tae Soo-mi\r\nJung Han-bit as young Tae Soo-mi\r\nHa Yoon-kyung as Choi Su-yeon\r\nJoo Jong-hyuk as Kwon Min-woo\r\nJoo Hyun-young as Dong Geu-ra-mi\r\nIm Sung-jae as Kim Min-shik\r\nOther characters\r\nShin Ha-young as Kim Hwa-young (ep. 2)\r\nYoon Joo-sang as Kim Gong-gu (ep. 2)\r\nYoon Yoo-sun as Jeon Gyeong-hee (ep. 3)\r\nChoi Dae-hoon as Jang Seung-jun (eps. 3, 15, 16)\r\nLee Sung-wook as Hwang Doo-yong (ep. 5)\r\nKim Hieora as Gye Hyang-shim (ep. 6)\r\nLee Ki-young as Ryu Myung-ha (eps. 6, 12)\r\nKim Sung-bum as Jo Hyeon-woo (eps. 7–8)\r\nPark Kang-seop as Park Yoo-jin (eps. 7–8)\r\nPark Yoon-hee as judge in charge of Sodeok-dong hackberry case (eps. 7–8)\r\nLee Doo-seok as Lee Jun-bum (eps. 8–10, 14, 16)\r\nKoo Kyo-hwan as Bang Gu-ppong (ep. 9)\r\nOh Hye-soo as Shin Hye-yeong (ep. 10)\r\nLee Won-jung as Yang Jeong-il (ep. 10)\r\nSeo Hye-won as Choi Da-hae (ep. 11)\r\nLee Bong-ryun as Ryu Jae-sook (ep. 12)\r\nLee Yoon-ji as Choi Ji-soo (eps. 13–14, 16)\r\nYoon Na-moo as Jung-nam (ep. 13)\r\nKim Joo-hun as Bae In-cheol (eps. 15–16)\r\nRyu Kyung-hwan as Kim Chan-hong (eps. 15–16)\r\nChoi Hyun-jin as Choi Sang-hyeon (eps. 15–16)\r\nEpisodes\r\nProduction\r\nFilming of the series wrapped up on July 14, 2022.\r\nOn August 17, 2022, president Lee Sang-baek of AStory, the production company for Extraordinary Attorney Woo, confirmed that the drama would be renewed for a second season.
