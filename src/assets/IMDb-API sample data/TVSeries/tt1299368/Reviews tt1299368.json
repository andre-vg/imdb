Everyone knows that there are thousands of cop shows out there to choose from but this is among the best and most original I've ever seen. It's a surprisingly fresh take on the cop show genre. Every episode is compelling and will hold your interest. Just read through the reviews to see what people really think of it. The cast is excellent and make it a very believable show. It's just such a gritty and realistic show about cops. It's a shame that it ended when it did because it should of went on for a few more seasons. With all the crap shows they revive these days I'd love to see them bring this show back."

It is also, arguably, the most underrated. It should never have been on NBC, which NBC realized, and then it went to cable at TNT. It flourished creatively, in its 4 seasons there, but never found it's audience. If this show had been on HBO, I think more people would have found it and sung its praises. Even Emmy didn't see what an incredible cast the show had and what brilliant writing it employed. Also, unlike so many long-running series, it's final Season 5 was its best. It was not supposed to be its final Season, TNT decided to cancel it, which only goes to show the unfulfilled promise that lay ahead.There was not a single bad performance with any cast regulars, but Michael Cudlitz and Regina King stand out, closely followed by Shawn Hattoy and Ben McKenzie. C. Thomas Howell blows it out of the water in a supporting role and Lucy Liu and Gerald McRaney nail it in guest spots. The scenes with Cudlitz and McRaney, S5 E7, Heroes, is the stuff that should be taught in acting classes and should have garnered both Emmy nominations.Best Season: 5 Best Episodes: Season 5, E7, 8, 9 and 10."

Some very funny in jokes an it has to be said sometimes characters that will drive you mad, but always entertaining.

It shows the struggles of the individual characters with life on and off the jobs as well as the supporting characters. It is definitely with a watch and you won't be disappointed.

This is a show about the LAPD but more than that its a journey with these characters and its a hell of a journey.Regina King and Michael Cudlitz are brilliant but the whole cast is outstanding. The dialog and storytelling are so cleverly done, it doesn't spoon feed you like some cop shows. At the end of season 5 I just wanted more.... so I watched it all again. Excellent!"

      "content": "Only time will tell how high the replay value is for this show, but watching from start to finish (though I don't recommend binge watching) proved an exhilarating and emotional stretch of series watching to rival the very best. It takes a lot to roll credits and leave me wanting more. \"Southland\" did that consistently (like a ravenous wolf I consumed this series). The documentary camera work, while adding a \"really there\" authenticity, also offered inventive angles and really ratcheted the tension at every turn. I couldn't get into \"The Shield\" partly because of the shaky-cam, but it really is well-done here. And \"Southland\" was almost always on-location (not to mention the wide array of inside-the- patrol-car shots), so the feeling of really being there was genuine. No wonder this show was so expensive. But it was the writing that kept me coming back for more. Events occur naturally on this show; even the rare use of the stock \"toxicology report confirms ...\" trope to keep the narrative going didn't feel forced (it's a contrivance on a great many cop shows). And these were characters I genuinely gave a damn about; there mistakes, weaknesses and the struggle to maintain humanity at the end of the day. Which was certainly helped by the stellar ensemble cast. Everyone here is terrific, particularly Regina King and Michael Cudlitz; episode after episode, these two deliver performances that get under your skin, and they are nothing short of captivating to watch. Cudlitz made Officer John Cooper one of the great characters of the genre - equal parts frustrating and fascinating. Give that man an Emmy. The cancellation of \"Southland\" is truly heartbreaking, as the season ended with all sorts of insanity coming to a head (and a bitter cliffhanger with no closure). But what we've gotten is some seriously riveting, impressive and haunting television, the likes of which I don't think I'll see again in the near future. Just an unbelievably high-quality show. Outstanding. 10/10"

I suppose my biggest concern is that one of my favorite shows (i.e. Freaks & Geeks, The Class, Undeclared, etc.) will again meet its' demise if not for full and utter fan support.Right out of the gate, this show grabs you with not necessarily likable characters, but real characters. It makes no excuses for the way people act or the situations life inevitably holds for us on a daily basis. It is not over-dramatized, watered-down or needlessly careful. It's appeal is rather than being presented as a miniseries, it is shot more in the tradition of a motion picture or cable series (not unlike The Wire -- best show EVER) where measures are taken after the shoot to make it prime time friendly without being corny or sappy.Though it's too early in the game to give this a 10, I can say that if you haven't checked this out yet, do yourself a favor -- you won't be disappointed."

Maybe so, it's not for kids or folks that cringe at what's really going on in the streets. Although the show was cancelled in 2013 can you imagine the format with todays life out there ? I'd like to see other great networks pick up the show and carry on with a revised series. I'd like to see the original actors because they were an awesome ensemble of professionals. Michael Cudlitz, Ben McKensie, Shawn Hatosy and the awesome Regina King, C. Thomas Howell, etc. These are top notch actors and the story writers were excellent. Whoever the technical advisors were, they trained the actors very well and it showed in their actions. I noticed some probably retired LAPD guys in cameo roles. Again, it's a rough life out on the streets and if people want to really see the truth, this is the show. So come on IMDB, LETS GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT !"

      "content": "To start I have to say that the pilot episode was amazing and the show only got better until the season finale.I have been policing for some time now and have yet to find a show that depicts policing as accurate as Southland. Sure there are some scenes in this series that are a bit over dramatized, as in any show; however, the attitudes, behaviours and problems officers face are very real.Many of the messages Cst. COOPER says to his \"rookie\" Cst. SHERMAN are very valid in policing today and are often utilized. SHERMAN's responses to things that he has to see and experience are spot on.The fact that many of the terms used in Southland are not sugar coated, as in other TV series, blows my mind and is what keeps me watching. I see far too much in other series where the characters actually seem awkward as their language doesn't reflect what their behaviour is showing or the producers want to appease the censors and use softer language.Having two separate views of cases may distract some people, but this is exactly what it is like in reality. There are detectives in the same division as the front line officers and although they may work together on some incidents, often go about their day on different paths.The finale is and what will make me a dedicated viewer because of how close it hits to home. As an officer you tend not to try and get involved in your neighbours business, this is a reality in today's world where anything can happen if you choose to do so.All in all amazing acting, real characters, real settings and scenarios. I recommended this show to all my co-workers and anyone else interested in television shows depicting policing as it really is.9/10 (Only reason I didn't give a 10 is because I don't believe anything is ever perfect)."

      "title": "This has been a long time coming....",
      "content": "Over the past twenty years we have seen an absolute invasion of cop shows and crime dramas on the small screen. Some have been highly acclaimed, like \"NYPD Blue\", and others have been long running, like \"Law and Order\". But all those shows developed notoriety based on strong characters and overly developed drama, a combination that seemed to be a necessary formula for prime time. The end result was entertainment at the cost of realism and integrity, as show plots became as convoluted as the characters. Think \"The Shield\", except that show had a very narrow focus. Now there's \"Southland\", and after the first few episodes it becomes immediately apparent that it is a show that will not be well received because it is vastly different than what has appeared before. Simply put, it will not live up to mass market expectations of what should constitute a crime drama. This is unfortunate. \"Southland\" offers a different perspective. It is simplistic without sacrificing depth, an effect achieved by cutting out unnecessary interactions and plot developments. The scope of coverage is revolutionary as well, with the portrayal of several different divisions--patrol, homicide, organized crime. The characters are developed and highlighted by both their strengths and flaws, making their statements through the performance of their duty without becoming preachy or pathetic. They are not all perfect and selfless, but instead are presented as basically moral and slightly jaded. It is not a testament as a whole of the LAPD, therefore it does not require the presentation of issues that are unnecessary to the purpose of the show--racism, sexism, corruption. The continuity is beneficial, and unusual enough to be revolutionary. The acting is solid. The greatest surprise is Regina King, who appears as a socially struggling homicide detective, a drastic change from the often overbearing or domineering African-American female roles she has been stuck in. Her portrayal of a heartfelt but complex detective is spot on. C. Thomas Howell delivers an absurdly believable rendition of an alcoholic, barrel-driven patrolman. Michael Cudlitz and Ben McKenzie are the most intriguing, as they are the rookie/veteran partnership who have common integrity and incredibly different backgrounds, yet manage to work together without the clichÃ©d buddy-buddy relationship. And the subject matter? Raw, gritty, realistic, without fanciful or violent action scenes. From the mundane, to the absurd, to the disturbing. The difficulties of police work are highlighted, and obstacles are not always overcome. It has been many years since a television show has delivered a straightforward, pulse-pounding episode, as evidenced by number seven, \"Derailed\". If you dislike crime dramas or cop shows, you obviously won't like Southland. For the rest, it will probably be a toss-up. Stop looking at what the show doesn't present, and focus instead on what it does offer, and you will discover how exceptional it is."

I really like this show because it really makes the primary players seem like they're 3D instead of just one sided. After a while you almost think you know them because they've done such a good job showing them dealing with life both on and off the job. The difference with how this show handles things is they never become a soap opera. Most other shows do.What I didn't like was the camera work. Trying to give it that \"Cops\" feel like a camera crew is following them often just made for bad shaky camera work. That and the way they didn't keep story lines in line. Like how Lidia dated a guy and he dumped her after they hooked up just once I think. Then she went through a couple of deceive partners, hooked up with a cop who she discovered was her female partners son. That and she ended ended up with another new partner. All this must have been a year or two since she hooked up with the first guy. Suddenly he's a family man who is the father her child too. It just didnt make sense.Otherwise it's a really good series. It's too bad it quit when it did. The way it left things there is easily one more season to tie things up, but I doubt that will ever happen."

This show has a \"fresh\" feel which makes it stands out. There is nothing like it. The first season was amazing. I'm not sure why I like it exactly but one of the reasons is that it takes CSI style cop drama and takes it a step further. Some times the subject matter and the way it is shot make it seem almost too realistic. It almost has a horror movie effect on me. I grip the edge of my seat."

      "title": "Very well-acted, superbly crafted, suspenseful drama with a point of view",
      "content": "At first this looked to be a kind of watered-down version of \"The Shield\" but the first-rate production work and the quality of the acting kept me interested. As the characters interacted and events unfolded I detected an intention to present a realistic -- if condensed -- version of life on the streets for LAPD. More importantly, I could sense that, unlike so many of today's TV dramas, this program seems to have something to say. Generally speaking, only TV producers Dick Wolf and David E. Kelley can be counted on to deliver on that score -- at least for the first ten years or so! For me, the jury is still out on \"Southland\". So far, so good ... Just watched the second episode -- better than the first -- solid! This really IS turning out to be a cop version of \"ER\" ... grounded in realistic detail ... focused on the minute by minute challenges of realistically portrayed characters. This one could be a keeper!"

      "content": "Just finished watching the last episode of season one. Astounding!Good TV shows like this don't seem to last for long. OZ, Homicide, 3rd Watch, Law & Order UK, Southland.Why? We need more. Please.Update after nearly finishing all episodes: Now I understand why it was cancelled - they ran out of content.The main recurring theme is partnership, trust, or lack thereof when some cops make mistakes either intentionally or not. It became tedious by the 4th season.The other theme is LA crime, and that got tedious quite quickly also because most of these thugs are: mid 20s, petty or gang crime, pregnant girl/wife, ruinign their child's life. It never evolves to other types of crime like corruption or premeditated murder, or whatever. Basically it is too dull to get the attention and when its not (like that police station shoot out) they don't give it enough story (ended up to be just a random guy. Wait, what?! You wasted a good story bois).It was good while it lasted. Auf Wiedersehen."

      "title": "strong show with uber-talented regina king.",
      "content": "i am impressed with this show. most of all i'm impressed with regina king. she is a standout talent in whatever role she takes on, and to say she is believable in this role is an understatement. not once do i stop believing i am actually watching a detective in the LAPD who is totally emotionally invested in her work. with her eyes she can convey more emotion than most actors can with the finest dialog Hollywood has to offer. ben mckenzie as \"ben\" is believable in this role. he seems to find roles that suit him well (stoic, troubled, mysterious, ready to throw down) and although he isn't quite a great actor he has great moments. michael cudlitz as his partner plays the role of the bully veteran patrolman to a T. anyone who hangs around with enough big city cops has met someone just like this guy (if not a dozen). his performance is a treat. with the heavy use of hand-held cameras and the documentary style of filming, at times it all combines to give the feel of a live-action reality show, and i can see why some onlookers were reportedly duped into thinking ben mckenzie had traded professions for real. there are some flaws in the show, and some of the story lines involving lesser characters seem contrived and unconvincing at times. but with a few adjustments and a whole lot more of miss regina king this show could find a place of its own amongst a crowded field of cop shows."

The first show I watched in a long time where I was just waiting for free time to continue the series. Reminiscent of cop novels I read long ago, but updated to modern LA."
