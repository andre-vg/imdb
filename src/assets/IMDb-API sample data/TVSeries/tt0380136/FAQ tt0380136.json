      "question": "Has the answer ever been \"Blue Whale\"?",
      "answer": "Yes, on the K Series episode, \"Kinetic\". The question was \"What is the largest animal on Earth?\" and Alan did not answer. (He was beaten to the buzzer by Marcus Brigstock.) Alan was (understandably!) very frustrated afterward.And in one of the F episodes in season 6 (\"France\"), Stephen Fry asked Alan a question in French (\"Tell me the name of a large marine animal that can't eat anything bigger than a grapefruit\") to which the correct answer was Blue Whale, but because it was in French, Alan didn't understand it."
