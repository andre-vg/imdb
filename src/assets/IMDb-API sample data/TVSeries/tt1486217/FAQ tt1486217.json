      "question": "What year does Archer take place in?",
      "answer": "The universe of Archer uses fashion and hairstyles from the early 1960s with a mix of 1980s architecture. Present-day technology such as smartphones and the internet as well as current social values such as the general acceptance of LGBT people and women in positions of power can also be seen in Archer. Countries that no longer exist today such as the Soviet Union still clearly exist in the Archer universe. \"The Cold War never ended\" is the most accepted theory put forward by the show's creator which mean's that Archer is set in the present day but in an alternate timeline from our own."
