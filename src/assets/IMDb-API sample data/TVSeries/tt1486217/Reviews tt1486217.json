      "content": "I love archer, such a good show, been watching it since 09 when it started, and hasn't gotten dull yet, there has been maybe the odd episode here and there that aren't my favourites but that's not saying I still didn't enjoy them. And in recent series archer has allowed itself to explore other story lines rather than him just being the worlds greatest spy, so long Brett, he was always useless but he died doing what he loved haha. Then when they became drug/gun smugglers, was just brilliant, I would say the detective season is not top my list but that gave us archer in a coma world, and the stories we've had from that have been amazing parodies, season 10 has one the best archer moments or more quotable moments. But that's not to say archer isn't full of quotable moments, this ones just new to add onto the growing list, but I won't spoil it for people. To anyone that hasn't watched archer should really check it out, and I hope we have many more archer adventures to come."

It features dialog peppered with obscenities, there is quite a bit of sex and sexual situations, the 'heroes' have absolutely moral compass and there are drugs, drugs, drugs galore. So, it clearly is a great little cartoon to watch...just don't let your kids, your mother or your preacher know you enjoy this show. And, there is plenty to enjoy-- mostly because the characters are funny, strange and like nothing you've ever seen. As for the stories, initially they are about a strange agency which does spying...for money. In other words, they are like mercenaries of the spy world. And, when that doesn't work out well (mostly because all their agents are idiots and have questionable sanity), they resort to selling cocaine. All in all, one of the most morally reprehensible yet funny cartoons you can watch. Just don't say I didn't warn you!"

      "content": "Archer is James Bond in sitcom form. Unlike Bond, Archer's mother is the head of the secret service agency he works for. And this mother and son couple do not get along at all. They find joy in the other's humiliation and/or pain. This show is incredibly entertaining, and while the animation is impressive in detail it feels weird to watch at times because it doesn't have the same 'flow' as cel-animation. That's probably because it's done on Adobe After Effects and/or Flash.Spy fiction is a creative pool writers can screw around with endlessly: they can dig into the many clichés of James Bond films, The Bourne Films, and just being all-round nostalgic for films of the 60s. It's like if Ian Fleming teamed up with Mel Brooks, Trey Parker and Matt Groening.Very good stuff, and guarantees your full attention and enjoyment."

You could go blind from the heightened dose of smartassery and the dialogue zings back and forth like flying bullets. It's actually kinda rare for an animated show -ANY- show to be as consistently funny as this one. It's insanely quotable and packs obscene replay value. Seriously, it goes down like candy. And I love that they made Archer's spy car a '70 Dodge Challenger. Bonus points, right there. This show's a personal favorite.10/10"

The animation really works with the style of the show.Who said comedy is best when it's offending at least one body of people? There's something for everyone to love in this show and probably something for everyone to hate in this show. The first episode I saw last night was very promising. I haven't seen a quirkier show in a long time. It really moves to the beat of its own drum. The pace is very fast and what struck me was, besides the absurd situations and hilarious dialog, the basic plot line has actually been very coherent and interesting.Don't miss this show. It's got a lot going for it."

The dialog is outrageously funny and naughty, containing serious amounts of irony and masked profanities. The plot of the show revolves around a secret agency (ISIS) and the relations between the people working there. The main character is the confident, arrogant and self-involved, yet not that adequate secret agent Sterling archer - a handsome hedonist man, that never cares about anyone but himself. Hilarious. 10/10"

I'm not familiar with Jon Benjamin who supplies Archer's voice but he's perfectly cast and his comic timing is spot on. The rest of the cast is strong too, especially Chris Parnell who's voice I immediately recognised from his very funny Dr Spaceman (or Spe-che-man) in 30 Rock.In a world where other offerings are losing their shine (Family Guy, American Dad and even South Park are not as fresh as they used to be and of course the Simpsons jumped it's shark years ago) Archer shows that there's still plenty of good material being written out there."

Think 'Venture Brothers' meets James Bond meets a truck load of self-obsessed heroine addicts and you'll begin to get an idea of what awaits us all in January when this series comes to the masses in prime time. Fans of H. Jon Benjamin will love him as he brings his own dead pan cadence to Sterling Archer, a character that is arguably the most narcissistic is television history. The writing is quick and sharp, the animation is stylized and hip and the laughs come faster than you can catch them.In short, watch for this amazing show to come to your TV in January and prepare to be amazed. Seriously, watch this show!"

I am also happy to see Jon Benjamin get some steady voice work and he was great in Dr Katz and Home Movies. I would recommend it to anyone to watch the first episode before making your judgment. This is the best pilot I have seen in a while and usually their pretty lame even on shows I think have promise.The show involves a super spy whose boss happens to be his mother. He has an ex lover as a fellow spy that is currently dating some guy in accounting. You have a blabby HR lady and some other people thrown into the mix like a secretary who is in love with Archer. The situations and under the breath comments are laugh out loud to me and my friends. I can't wait for more."

I love Venture Bros. and other quirky Adult Swim shows, and of course various other animated shows with an adult target audience, such as Family Guy, South Park, Futurama, and the like. Of course, ARCHER is not on Adult Swim, but obviously it would fit right in. Fow now it is on TNT, which is great. I like the idea that a network other than FOX is getting into the this genre. Maybe we will see more shows like this pop up in the ratings battle.H. John Benjamin is brilliant, needless to say. I laugh my self silly every time I watch this show, and it is hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. I think, right now, I like SKYTANIC the most, although DIVERSITY HIRE was absolutely hysterical. I have to say SKYTANIC stands out particularly because of the end sequence when Archer and Lana are trying to disarm the bomb, and they have that genius dialog with the technical support team. I would almost describe it as being inspired by the old Abbot and Costello routine \"Who's on First?\" For those of you who have seen the episode, I am sure you know what I am talking about it. For those of you who haven't seen this particular episode, I say, check it out, set your DVR, and you will see what I mean and probably pee your pants. For those of you that have not seen this show at all, I say: What are you? Some kind of idiot? Do you live under a rock? Watch the show already! Its super funny."

I am a total TV alchoholic and this show is incredibly funny. Though there is a slight issue with the comedy, if you take yourself too seriously and or you can't laugh at sheer stupidity the show might not be for you. Anyways you won't know if you like the comedy or not without watching and episode yourself. So I strongly incourage everyone to sit down watch an episode or two and I bet you will be rolling on the floor due to the doucheness that is Sterling Archer. Alright Andy I know the fact that arrested development got canceled still hurts but it doesn't mean you should start bashing a different kind of comedy. Archer is incredibly funny, and yes it is basic raunchy humor, but it is the sheer ridiculousness of each situation that allows the comedy to turn in literal loll. so open your mind laugh at a Russian roulette joke and enjoy the brilliant stupidity that is Archer."

These sort of animated shows are good but old and don't change the formula of a successful show. They are all the same, a family/ group of friends getting into mischief everyday and each day is completely different but with the same people.At first I though Archer was just going to be another comedy cartoon like Family guy. I thought it would be loads of random jokes (not saying random jokes aren't funny but Seth Macfarlane has been doing the same routine over and over) and hardly any story, but I tell you now I was wrong, so terribly wrong.Archer is pure brilliance. It's like James Bond became an abusive alcoholic and that everyone he works with are insane. It looks pretty and is well animated, it's full of funny jokes and most importantly of all it has a story line that runs through out the whole series!I love Archer because it doesn't have a new story every episode and forgetting what happened last time. You get to know the characters and see them develop as episode go on. The show doesn't shy away from changing things up, one minute you think that it's just an ordinary mission and the next minute something massive happens which leads to a character changing and this is who the character will act from now on.The jokes are funny and always make me laugh and sometimes the situations they get in are funny. The character are horrible people, if you met them in really life you would hate them but in the show you can't help but love everyone. The show also introduces loads of new characters that stick around or return every now and again for a episode.I have loved watching every episode and I've just started season 5 which is insane. The best animated TV show I have ever watched! 10/10 Highly recommend watching if you like shows like South park, American Dad, Bobs Burgers, Robot Chicken and Frisky Dingo."

Archer has some of the best character flaws on television. Sterling Archer is the womanizing main character who despite his aloofness and major flaws is one of ISIS best agents. Lana Kane plays his mocha ex lover who loves inter-racial porn and turtleneck skirts. Carol or cheryl or crystal, whatever her name is this week, is the sex crazed secretary who like to be choked in bed. Cyril is the comptroller who is somehow sleeping with Lana while trying to impress her more than Archer. Malory is Archer's mother/leader of ISIS. Her dog duchess spawned archer's codename and her torid love affairs with other spies all over the world get in the way of ISIS being the number 1 spy organization. And Pam is the chubby outspoken HR rep who is always looking for some way to appreciated while also insulting Carol for being Carol. The characters in the show mix so well together that each episode has the ability to be rewatched numerous times. Watch Archer on FX and see for yourself"

      "content": "When Archer first aired it was my favourite TV show, it was slick and the humor just hit the spot but the writers have managed to destroy this once great show. When they changed from secret agents to drug dealers I persisted even though it was pretty poor simply because I liked the characters and it still had the odd chuckle but each season since has become less and less funny until we reach Dreamland, this is where it has become so bad I haven't been able to finish an episode yet. It's bland, unfunny and just plain boring. The show has been renewed for more seasons still and I can only fear at how bad it will become. I originally rated Archer an 8, since season 5 its slowly decreased until I can't give it any more than a terrible 1. To coin an Archer phrase 'eat a d1ck, writers!'."

      "content": "ArcherWatched The Lot TwiceThe quality of the script writing its inventiveness and shear individuality is truly astounding.What is so refreshing is it's mostly total ability to insult everyone equally and it's total lack of political correctness when the thought police are everywhere. This could be summed up when Mallory is being told she is a racist and she says \"I am rude to all the servants equally, at best I could be described as an elitist!\"Adam Reed piles on the homoerotic images and every camp joke is there in spades, such fun!A must see for those into adult cartoons and a classic of our time!"

      "content": "As is the case with oh so many shows, Archer gets farther and farther away from its core premise as it desperately tries not to bore the audience the first few seasons created. This percieved neccessity of capitalizing on a success and not letting a show go when it has said what it had to say, but instead releasing season after season of consecutively worse material as long as the ratings justify it, is the cause of many shows's unsatisfying later seasons. This is done, of course, for profit. It's seemingly hard for creatives in the industry to push new ideas, which means they are more likely to stick to a show while it's making money."
