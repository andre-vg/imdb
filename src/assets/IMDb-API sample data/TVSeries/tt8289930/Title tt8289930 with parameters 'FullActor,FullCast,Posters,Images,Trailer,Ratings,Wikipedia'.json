This season covers the trials and tribulations of the Scuderia Ferrari, the porpoising issue of the Mercedes W13, the path leading up to Sergio Pérez' win at the Monaco Grand Prix, the controversy surrounding Oscar Piastri's contract dispute, and Daniel Ricciardo's struggles at McLaren. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen confirmed that Season 5 marks his first full appearance within in-show interviews, having criticized it in the past for fabricating events that happened during the World Championships.\r\nEpisodes\r\nSeason 1 (2019)\r\nSeason 2 (2020)\r\nSeason 3 (2021)\r\nSeason 4 (2022)\r\nSeason 5 (2023)\r\nProduction and concept\r\nOn 24 March 2018, Formula One announced that Netflix had commissioned a ten episode docu-series giving an exclusive behind the scenes look at the 2018 Formula One World Championship. On 24 July 2019, Formula One announced that a second season would premiere in 2020 covering the 2019 Formula One World Championship, involving all 10 teams.\r\nThe series is executively produced by James Gay-Rees and Paul Martin for the production company, Box to Box Films. Sophie Todd is the production's showrunner.\r\nGay-Rees subsequently went on to reveal to The Fast Lane Podcast that Drive to Survive had originally been conceived as a series revolving solely around Red Bull Racing before it evolved into a series about F1 in general.\r\nFilming began for the 2020 season in March but was suspended until July due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nRelease\r\nThe trailer for the first season was released on 20 February 2019, and on 8 March 2019 the series premiered on Netflix.\r\nThe trailer for the second season was released on 17 February 2020, and the season premiered on Netflix on 28 February 2020.\r\nThe trailer for the third season was released on 19 February 2021, and the season premiered on Netflix on 19 March 2021.\r\nThe trailer for the fourth season was released on 28 February 2022, and the season premiered on Netflix on 11 March 2022. Between 6 March 2022 and 20 March 2022, the series was watched for 57.03 million hours according to Netflix's top 10 list.\r\nReception\r\nThe show has received recognition for the additional insight it offers fans, and is credited with attracting new audiences (particularly American) to the sport. The condensing of season-long themes into single-episode narratives has drawn praise for adapting \"the natural drama of a racing season into a narrative that can encourage a fan to tune into the real thing.\"\r\nHowever, Drive to Survive has been criticized for including fake or misplaced commentary and team radios, staging certain scenes, placing undue importance on test and practice sessions, and over-dramatizing or misrepresenting certain events and relationships within the Formula One paddock. The continued criticism from both audiences and drivers led to discussions between Netflix and team managers and between Formula One and drivers.\r\nMax Verstappen notably refused to participate in interviews for seasons 2, 3, and 4 as he believed that the show dramatized some drivers by portraying them as villians and that the show manufactured fake rivalries. However, Verstappen confirmed his participation in season 5 after reaching an agreement with the producers to \"keep it real\".\r\nAwards and nominations\r\nSpin-offs\r\nIn 2020, a version of Drive to Survive was released on F1 TV based around the 2019 Formula 2 Championship, called Chasing the Dream. Subsequent second and third seasons were produced, each covering the 2020 Formula 2 Championship and the 2021 Formula 2 Championship, premiering in 2021 and 2022 respectively.",

The teams and drivers all prepare their cars for the upcoming races. This year also marks the largest changes to the cars in many years. Controversy arises when <span>Haas F1 Team</span> drops its major sponsor <span>Uralkali</span> along with its sponsored driver <span>Nikita Mazepin</span> due to the <span>Russian invasion of Ukraine</span>. Haas brings back <span>Kevin Magnussen</span> after he was let go from the team back in 2020. Current World Champion <span>Max Verstappen</span> finally makes an appearance on the show after having declined to appear in previous seasons. In the early races many teams, especially the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team</span>, have to deal with issues of <span>porpoising</span>, a potential problem related to Ground Effect, which returned after having been banned in 1982. The first race, the <span>2022 Bahrain Grand Prix</span>, is shown with both of the Red Bull cars losing power, <span>Scuderia Ferrari</span> achieving their first win in 910 days with their drivers <span>Charles Leclerc</span> and <span>Carlos Sainz Jr.</span> taking first and second place respectively and Kevin Magnussen achieving fifth place on his first outing back at Haas.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep42\" style=\"text-align:center\">42</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Bounce Back\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">24 February 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #00FF00\">Mercedes' W13 Is put to the test at pre-season tests at Bahrain with <span>Lewis Hamilton</span> and new teammate <span>George Russell</span> behind the wheel. However, the car exhibits an incredibly unpleasant drive with an excessive amount of porpoising. The team has noticed the issue and plans to work on it before further tests commence. However, for Mercedes, the issue seems to remain unfixed. Indeed, the issues are present coming to the races at <span>Imola</span>, <span>Spain</span>, and <span>Monaco</span>, before arriving at the <span>Baku City Circuit</span> for <span>Azerbaijan</span>. Lewis' back starts to exhibit pain as he goes down the straights of Baku as Max Verstappen takes home the victory with Lewis taking fourth.

The <span>Silverstone</span> round, which also coincided with <span>Zhou Guanyu</span>'s big crash coming into Abbey, finishes with Lewis taking third place and Carlos Sainz Jr. taking his first career victory in Formula One.

Ferrari's two drivers Charles Leclerc - who is leading the Drivers' Championship coming into the race - and Carlos Sainz Jr. lock out the first two rows of the grid. In the race, Verstappen immediately takes second from Sainz, and would take the lead by the ninth lap. Soon, McLaren's Lando Norris makes contact with Pierre Gasly of AlphaTauri, bringing out the safety car. Leclerc's old tires soon give him a disadvantage, which Verstappen exploits in his first victory in Miami. Leclerc finishes second ahead of his teammate. As the season continues, Ferrari continues to make errors that end up costing their drivers the win; in Monaco, Leclerc leads the race as Sainz is brought in - but Leclerc, having been told to come in too, follows Sainz into the pits - only being told to stay out after he had already came in for his stop - handing Red Bull's <span>Sergio Pérez</span> the victory as Leclerc finishes fourth; in Baku, both Ferraris - Leclerc leading - retire due to mechanical failure with Verstappen winning; and in <span>Canada</span>, both Ferraris stay out again and are inconvenienced by their old rubber, handing Verstappen the win once again. At a rainy Silverstone qualification, Sainz scores his first pole position in his career, and Leclerc, having spun earlier in quali, takes third. The race starts with a big crash for Zhou Guanyu, red-flagging the race. The race starts with Sainz, having retained his grid position, getting a good start; by lap ten, Sainz continues to control the field, but makes an error, allowing Verstappen to take the lead. However, the Red Bull driver reports a puncture and pits, allowing Sainz to take the lead again with Leclerc behind. Soon, the Ferrari pit wall tells Sainz to give the position to Leclerc as <span>Esteban Ocon</span> retires due to mechanical issues, bringing out a safety car. As Leclerc is told to stay out on his old tires, Sainz is brought in for fresh rubber.

The paddock travels to the <span>Jeddah Corniche Circuit</span> for <span>the second running</span> of the <span>Saudi Arabian Grand Prix</span>; as qualification for the race begins, Mick's run grinds to a halt when he suffers a big crash, ruling him out of the race due to the damage sustained to his car. Schumacher continues to struggle after Saudi; in Miami, Schumacher, in ninth place, collides with <span>Sebastian Vettel</span>, taking both drivers out of the race; he starts his Monaco run at the back of the field, only to lose it coming into the swimming pool section and splitting his car in half in the ensuing crash. By the time the paddock has traveled to Baku, Magnussen has led the championship for the Haas team with 15 points against Schumacher's 0, and faces a lot of pressure over his future in the team. Schumacher starts the race in last place, while Magnussen rises up the field. However, Magnussen's race is stopped due to an engine issue, leaving Haas' chance for points in the hands of a slow-running Schumacher. Indeed, Schumacher is running very slowly to the point he is lapped by the leading Verstappen. Away from the track, Schumacher trains with his personal trainer, convinced he can still score points. At Silverstone, Schumacher starts at the back of the grid, but the session is red-flagged due to a big crash for Zhou Guanyu, which the Haas drivers manage to avoid. Schumacher and Magnussen are due to start 16th and 14th, respectively. Schumacher pushes through the field - and with an overtake on Ricciardo, a DRS-assisted overtake on Vettel - and ultimately Verstappen, he ultimately manages to finish eighth - his first points in Formula One, sending the Haas pit wall into a celebration; Vettel and Verstappen also congratulate Schumacher for his efforts during the race. However, despite his efforts in the race, Mick's seat in the Haas team remains open.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep45\" style=\"text-align:center\">45</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Pardon My French\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">24 February 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #00FF00\">Under the management of new team principal <span>Otmar Szafnauer</span>, <span>Alpine F1 Team</span> goes into 2022 retaining their drivers <span>Fernando Alonso</span>, a veteran of <span>Team Enstone</span> and two-time Champion, and Esteban Ocon, the driver who took Alpine to their <span>first victory</span> since <span>2014</span>, with a new reserve driver in Australian driver and 2021 Formula Two champion <span>Oscar Piastri</span>. Alpine scores consistent points scores in Miami, Baku, and <span>Austria</span>. By the <span>French</span> round - the home race of Alpine - McLaren and Alpine are tied for sixth in the Constructors' Championship. Early into the race, Alonso edges past Norris for fourth, with Ocon behind him. However, Ocon inadvertantly takes <span>Yuki Tsunoda</span> out of the race, giving him a five-second penalty. Pitting soon after drops him down out of the points, with Alonso now sixth and a second behind Norris. Alonso holds the McLarens up to buy enough time for Ocon to pass them. Alonso finishes sixth and Ocon eighth in their home race. Before <span>Hungary</span>, it is revealed that four-time Champion Sebastian Vettel will retire from Formula One, sending the paddock and media into a frenzy with the prospect of a \"silly season\" on the horizon; Szafnauer is adamant that Alonso is staying with Alpine for 2023. Hungary is the make-or-break round for Alpine - both drivers need to score higher points than McLaren to achieve fourth in the Constructors' Championship. Ricciardo and <span>Lance Stroll</span> both overtake the Alpines, but Ricciardo punts Stroll off the track, giving him a five-second penalty. Alonso and Ocon barely hold on to the points, and Ricciardo finishes fifteenth after his penalty, allowing Alpine to secure fourth place. The team and their title sponsors <span>BWT</span> celebrate at a sponsor dinner. The next day, Alonso reveals he had received a call from Aston Martin team owner <span>Lawrence Stroll</span> to replace the outgoing Vettel, moving him out of Team Enstone. Left with no other option, Alpine announce Piastri for the 2023 season, and McLaren are looking to replace Ricciardo with Piastri, who they have had eyes on.

Indeed, McLaren has announced Ricciardo's retirement from the team after the season, with Piastri taking his spot. Meanwhile, Alpine are still reeling from the losses of Piastri and Alonso, but the Piastri fiasco has backed both Alpine and McLaren into a wall, with Alpine potentially taking Piastri to court and McLaren CEO <span>Zak Brown</span> potentially having to pay Piastri and Alpine - and given Ricciardo's near-consistent results back at Team Enstone back in the 2019 season, it remains unknown if he would return considering his decision to move to McLaren in 2021. The <span>Dutch</span> round is the first ever since the announcement, and Ricciardo and Gasly, both winners of past races, are looking to perform their best. Gasly fights with Alonso in the midfield as Ricciardo, having received fresher rubber, pushes on Vettel while Alonso manages to take Gasly up. Ricciardo continues to drop down the field as both Haas drivers pass him. Gasly finishes eleventh with Ricciardo in seventeenth.

Sophie Todd is the production's showrunner.</p><p>Gay-Rees subsequently went on to reveal to The Fast Lane Podcast that Drive to Survive had originally been conceived as a series revolving solely around Red Bull Racing before it evolved into a series about F1 in general.</p><p>Filming began for the 2020 season in March but was suspended until July due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>The trailer for the first season was released on 20 February 2019, and on 8 March 2019 the series premiered on Netflix.</p><p>The trailer for the second season was released on 17 February 2020, and the season premiered on Netflix on 28 February 2020.</p><p>The trailer for the third season was released on 19 February 2021, and the season premiered on Netflix on 19 March 2021.</p><p>The trailer for the fourth season was released on 28 February 2022, and the season premiered on Netflix on 11 March 2022.

The condensing of season-long themes into single-episode narratives has drawn praise for adapting \"the natural drama of a racing season into a narrative that can encourage a fan to tune into the real thing.\"</p><p>However, Drive to Survive has been criticized for including fake or misplaced commentary and team radios, staging certain scenes, placing undue importance on test and practice sessions, and over-dramatizing or misrepresenting certain events and relationships within the Formula One paddock. The continued criticism from both audiences and drivers led to discussions between Netflix and team managers and between Formula One and drivers.</p><p>Max Verstappen notably refused to participate in interviews for seasons 2, 3, and 4 as he believed that the show dramatized some drivers by portraying them as villians and that the show manufactured fake rivalries.
