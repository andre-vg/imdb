      "title": "All comedies should be like this",
      "content": "Having just watched this series again, I am prepared to say that \"Spaced\" is definitely one of the greatest comedy shows EVER!Funny, striking, imaginative, clever, compassionate, sarcastic, inventive, etc, etc, etc. You get the impression that co-stars and co-writers, Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, just cannot write a boring line of dialogue or envisage a predictable scene. Using its \"nothing new\" premise (mismatched couple pretend to be romantically entangled to find a place to live), this show twists and turns its way off into many brilliant and original directions, while never failing to provide the required belly laughs along the way.It uses movie in-jokes and references in a way that would make Tarantino envious, and the hipness of its execution makes it both a show that, paradoxically, is of the moment but is also certain to be talked about in ten or twenty years from now.The cast are all first-rate: Pegg and Stevenson manage to be both madcap and touching, and are backed up by a sterling supporting cast of fresh and exciting talent. Julia Deakin as Marsha, the flirtatious middle-aged landlady and Mark Heap as the pretentious but vulnerable artist from hell, Brian, make a hilarious double act; Nick Frost is a real find as military mad Mike; and Katy Carmichael as the initially snobby Twist manages to be dotty without turning up the annoyance factor.Even the guest appearances are great. My two personal favourites are Michael Smiley as the chemically enhanced Tyres O'Flaherty, a non-stop raver who even dances to the ringing of a telephone; and the excellent Charles Dale (II), who is usually cast as the heavy, but gives a marvellous comic performance here as the \"yes man\" security guard who helps our bumbling heroes rescue their beloved pooch, Colin, from an evil freelance vivisectionist!Credit must also be given to director Edgar Wright who has created a unique and vivid look to the show, enhancing the script's wired look at the banalities of everyday life with his brilliant use of camera movement, lighting, cross-cutting, flashbacks, etc. Even if it wasn't funny (which it most emphatically is), \"Spaced\" would get top marks for being the best looking show on the box.I could go on, but \"Spaced\" is a comedy that needs to be seen to be believed, and then seen again...and again...and again..."

      "title": "This is what I have been waiting for!!",
      "content": "I am writing this comment after watching _all_ 14 episodes of Spaced that are currently available in what was basically one sitting. Living in Germany I had been totally unaware of this rare gem among all the mediocrity and outright rubbish that is usually aired on TV until the owner of my favourite video shop (which specializes in US and UK imports) pointed out the Series 1 and Series 2 DVDs to me.Right after I had seen about 10 minutes of the very first episode I was hooked. I am about the same age as the main characters in the series and many of their traits and interests seemed uncannily familiar. Maybe I should be a bit worried about being able to easily identify with Tim's motivations and obsessions or about actually knowing people like Mike myself... Uhm, I'll better not delve into all this, but let me say that watching all those familiar situations, topics of discussion and reactions of people being acted out so convincingly by the cast was pure enjoyment for me - unlike anything else I had ever seen on the telly!And then there are the pop culture references. Most of them are to films or TV series. If you are a film buff or comicbook/scifi geek and have always got some fun out of the film refs in Simpsons episodes _please_ by all means watch Spaced! Not only are these scenes all very well done and intelligently embedded into the narrative - it's also the whole context of the series and its characters that makes all the references so, uhm, fitting and, well, funny. (It's a bit hard to describe really, and I'm not going to spoil anything by giving examples... just watch it!)Taking in everything in one go I also found it nice that there's a consistent story arc that stretches across all 14 episodes, and I also liked the references to earlier episodes that were sometimes made, especially in the 2nd series.Well. I must say I feel a little bad now about having blown all this on one single day. I mean, you're supposed to save good and precious things and use them sparingly over time. But sometimes things are so f***ing good that you just have to have it all, at once, until nothing's left.So what do I do now with no more unseen Spaced for me to watch? Bloody 'ell, I'll just watch all 14 episodes again, tomorrow!!"

Perhaps the reason that it wasn't as successful as it should have been was that it didn't get a large enough audience. It was aired in a time when \"The Royle Family\" undeservedly won all the awards and praise, whereas Spaced was considered to be aimed at immature adolescents, film parodies and comic book references only worthy of an audience that doesn't know quality when they see it. And this is a tragedy, because, if television series' can be considered art form by any stretch of the imagination, then this is a masterpiece, something to be admired by others, a definite benchmark for all other programmes."

Well, even without any subtitles (I get around in English), \"Spaced\" appears to me as the exact epitome of what British TV can do at its best : a perfect brew of comedy, rhythm, political incorrectness, extraordinary acting, stylish writing, socially-oriented matters... I really was mesmerized at the creativity both screenwriters and director displayed all along the 14 episodes, always renewing what could be taken as pure show-off style on the first one. This is why I love British comedy, TV & cinema. Wit. Man do they have it. Simon Pegg if you ever read this : you ARE the Force !"

      "title": "It's life Tim, and boy, do they know it.",
      "content": "\"Spaced\" is like watching the cartoon of the life of the average SFX reader or Ain't-it-Cool UK talkbacker. It's the closest thing to fanboy (and fangirl) heaven there is. By that, I don't mean it's a perfect word for word film version of Lord of the Rings nor even a big BBC production of Asimov's Foundation trilogy. No, this is where really good fanboys (and fangirls) go when they die.Set around the lives of Tim Bisley and Daisy Steiner sharing a ground floor flat somewhere in North London it shows in a disturbingly honest way the lives of the average late 20-something, recently moved to London, wannabe creative, painfully middle-class, skint people in much the same way that David Attenborough might bring to life the daily trials of a family of pandas. Their many rituals and habits are studied in detail as they go about carving their way in the cruel world around them. We see them go clubbing, going to sign on, in the pub, and rescuing dogs from animal testing laboratories. The one thing that leads me to think that this is only a sitcom and not real life is that their flat is always suspiciously clean.As Tim is a struggling graphic artist trying to break into the world of comic illustration, it's appropriate that the characters are all cartoons themselves. They almost spew stylised behaviour, phrases and clothes. Some even have their own signature moves such as Brian's standardised description of his 'work' when he is asked what he paints. The editing follows this lead with many cut-aways into people's thoughts much in the manner of a thought bubble. The sheer quantity of cultural references is staggering. However, having lived a life similar to this, I know the number of cultural references in real life is at about the same level.If you're currently aged between 27 and 34, this is the only sitcom you'll ever need to see again. Well, Black Books is pretty good too. Anyway, there are few things that make me laugh as much of this. If you know the words to the Ewok song, watch this."

It's a great alternative slacker sitcom chalk full of pop references. The second series is better, and more well written. The first one is a little bit uneven. But more than anything, it gave us two important things. First, it gave us Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Second, it gave us Burning Star Wars Paraphernalia for The Phantom Menace.

The true genius is in the fact that you could probably watch this with your vicar and - apart from a low swearing incidence - they would find little to criticise (unlike, say, equally funny but edgier shows; Chris morris' work for example) but it still makes perfect post-pub viewing. When one sees the dross that usually passes for sitcom in the UK, once-great Shakespearean actors mugging at the camera and silently cursing their agent as the canned laughter robotically shrieks, you wonder why they don't just hand over the entire comedy drama section of UK TV to Pegg, Stevenson, Bailey, Moran and Serafinowicz. Please make more. Please."

      "content": "I've just spent five hours watching the most terrific British sitcom, \"Spaced.\" Now my inner voice speaks with an English accent and I'm left wondering if maybe I grew up on the wrong side of the Atlantic. I am an American viewer, and I'm sad that it has taken so long for this show to reach the States.In \"Spaced\" there are references comic books, Tekken, and Evil Dead II. It is also worth noting that Tim, one of the main characters in \"Spaced,\" lost his job over \"The Phantom Menace.\" I thoroughly enjoyed my hours of uninterrupted British indulgence. I recommend \"Spaced\" because it's so darn funny. Tim, played by Simon Pegg, is the assistant manager of a comic book shop. His boss's name is Bilbo Bagshot (I'm serious) and said boss has slugged people out on at least two occasions because the one getting slugged said that \"Hawke the Slayer\" was crap. Also, Peter Serafinowicz (aka the Voice of Darth Maul) turns up as the slick-suit who stole Tim's girlfriend away. They have a great showdown on a paintball course.Also wonderful is Daisy (Jessica Stevenson), the other main character. She's a writer, but comes up with all sorts of creative ways to avoid actual writing. The in-jokes are brilliant, the directing is fresh, the acting is endearing without being sappy. The next time this show airs on Trio or BBC America, grab some popcorn and hoard the remote because you'll want to watch all of it."

      "content": "This series is centred on Tim Bisley and Daisy Steiner; two twenty somethings who meet while each is looking for a new place to live; unfortunately everywhere each of them want to live is for couples. Then they hit on the idea of pretending to be a couple to hire a flat together. They get a place in a house belonging to Marsha, who lives upstairs with her teenaged daughter; Brian, an artist lives in the flat downstairs. Other key characters are Tim's friend Mike, who was kicked out of the Territorial Army for stealing a tank and trying to invade Paris and Daisy's friend Twist.Over the course of two seasons (fourteen episodes) they get involved in various amusing antics. This includes going to some performance art involving an old friend of Brian's; going clubbing; looking for jobs and rescuing Daisy's dog from a rogue vivisectionist. Along the way they meet a variety of characters; some of whom return in further episodes.It is hard to believe this series in now twenty years old as it still feels very fresh. There are lots of great jokes and many fun references to classic, and some not-so-classic films... don't mention 'The Phantom Menace' to Tim. The success of the series is down to the great characters; Tim and Daisy are fairly normal and those around them are just a little bit over the top without feeling unbelievable. Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson are great as Tim and Daisy and Nick Frost, Julia Deakin, Mark Heap and Katy Carmichael are just as good as Mike, Marsha, Brian and Twist. The guest cast, which includes plenty of familiar faces is also solid. The situations are a good blend of the everyday and the slightly exaggerated; this works well and keeps the laughs coming. Surprisingly for a sitcom the laughs don't seem overly forced. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who likes a good laugh; I'd only caution that the language might be a bit strong for some viewers."

      "title": "\"Spaced\" is the Ultimate Geek's Sitcom",
      "content": "As a fan of Edgar Wright and his films, discovering \"Spaced\" on Hulu a few years ago was an epic surprise. I'd had no idea that Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost had done a two-series television show in England and it came as no surprise that it was full to the brim with the geekiest of references. It's bound to appeal to anyone who loves their films and, as popular as their films have become with American audiences, I'm surprised \"Spaced\" hasn't found some sort of syndication on this side of the Atlantic to introduce a whole new audience. The premise of the show isn't something we haven't seen a hundred times before in other sitcoms but it's the execution that makes it stand out. The show opens with Tim Bisley (Pegg) meeting Daisy Steiner (Jessica Hynes); Tim has just gone through a nasty breakup and Daisy is hoping to move out of the flat where she's squatting with a bunch of losers. Options are scarce until they discover an advertisement for a flat available for \"professional couples\" so Tim and Daisy agree to pose as a couple in order to move in. The series follows the lives of these two and their eccentric friends: militaristic Mike (Frost), struggling artist Brian (Mark Heap), fashion-obsessed Twist (Katy Carmichael), and their perpetually drunken landlady Marsha (Julia Deakin). Over the course of the fourteen episodes, they will pursue their dreams, form relationships, engage in robot battles, and, in Tim's case, come to terms with a crippling hatred for THE PHANTOM MENACE.One of the coolest parts of Wright's films is the constant barrage of homage to other films he loves and, subsequently, influenced him. \"Spaced\" is no different, as each episode could be spent just counting the references to iconic films, television shows, and video games. It's a geek cornucopia. And to those fearing that the focus of the series is on forcing in Star Wars or X-Files sight gags, there is nothing to worry about. The show, written by stars Pegg and Hynes, is well written and consistently hilarious. Imagine a sitcom in the vein of \"Friends\" but aimed at the film geek crowd and better written. It's sad that the series only lasted the two series because fourteen episodes was enough to get me hooked but I would've loved to see where these characters lives went, especially since the final episode does sort of hint at some changes in the characters' dynamics. The first series was fun but it wasn't until the second series that the show really seemed to find it's footing and had some great stuff. In particular, the second series episode 'Gone' where it builds the most on the relationship between Tim and Daisy. The whole series is built on the usual \"will they or won't they\" relationship dynamic but it never really focuses on it, and this episode gives the two the most time together where we actually get to see them come a little closer over the course of one night's drunken/stoned adventure.As fun as all that is, it's the bizarre characters that inhabit the world of \"Spaced\" that really make the show addicting. In its short run, the show managed to flesh out these characters better than most other sitcoms I've seen. Tim is pursuing his career as a graphic artist with dreams of drawing for a major comics company and, oddly enough for Simon Pegg, I actually found the character to be the least likable (note: not unlikable). Tim's somewhat self-centered and makes obvious on multiple occasions that he'd often rather not be bothered with others' problems while he pines away for his ex-girlfriend. Still, he's a goofball and he's got his moments. Daisy is far more caring but she's not without her own flaws. A professional procrastinator, she's slowly but surely working her way towards a life in journalism if she'd just sit in front of the typewriter long enough. Her feelings toward Tim become pretty obvious early on in the series but Tim's pretty oblivious to it all. My personal favorite would be Brian, the spastic artist living on the bottom flat. Mark Heap created the most memorable character of the series with Brian, always on edge and awkward beyond words in social situations. The episode focused on his reunion with a former artist colleague (series one, episode three: 'Art') is one of the best purely because we get the most time with his character, and his later (short-lived) relationship with Twist in the second series gives it some of the funniest jokes.\"Spaced\" is a must-see show for anyone who fell in love with Wright, Pegg, and Frost in the Three Cornetto Trilogy films. It's all of the fun of their big screen features dished out in bite-sized 25 minutes episodes. While it doesn't have the same strong laughs that I found in \"The IT Crowd\", the characters and stories are infinitely more complex and the whole production has got Wright's trademark visual flair to give it some extra appeal. \"Spaced\" really was a great show and another prime example of fantastic British television."

But \"Spaced,\" weirdly enough, manages to balance its sarcasm and weirdness with brains and creativity and even a dash of sentiment. I like the characters, and I root for them to succeed, which is more than I can say for the jerks on \"Seinfeld\" or \"Sex and the City\"! I've also gotta admire Spaced because it looks so damned cool. Director Edgar Wright probably labored under a typical British budget of eight pence per episode, but he created some really freakish and memorable imagery. And the camera-work is great - how often can you say that about a sitcom? I have a slight preference for the second-season episodes, but basically the whole thing rules. I find it addicting. Once I watch the first episode, I find that I have to blast through the whole series in a day or two.I have maybe only one interesting (and possibly heretical) observation. Has anyone else noticed that, of all the lead characters, Daisy is the only one who's sort of unpleasant? Think about it..."

      "title": "Constantly clever, funny and imaginative - Friends doesn't even deserve to be on the same channel!",
      "content": "The adventures of Tim and Daisy who rent a room in Marsha Klein's house under the pretence that they are a couple. Also in the house is frustrated painter Brian. Together with TA fanatic Mike and Brian's girlfriend Twist the duo get into a series of situations with hilarious results.From my synopsis this could be Friends UK - group of people live together and get into series of misunderstandings etc. But this is channel 4, this is written by Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson! Of course it's going to be better than that. Friends is all gloss and is pretty simple and contrived each week - Spaced has a mad energy about it that loses the gloss but replaces it with intelligence, wit, great dialogue and overall a great imagination. The story lines are never along the same lines as Friends - instead we have confrontation with youths in a pub, lost dogs, mixed up comic art portfolios etc., and they're never solved in the same way as Friends' predicaments are. Instead they are always far fetched - imagine a stand off with a group of yobs being solved by a huge, slow-mo shoot out using fingers as guns (this is really well down and isn't as silly as it sounds!).The level of imagination around the stories is huge - it's filled with funny movie references like The Simpson, but more integrated with the action (i.e. not all background stuff), literally every show will have several scenes that echo scenes from films - but even if you don't get those there's still plenty to enjoy. The dialogue is hilarious, the characters are larger than life and the stories are so imaginative you can't help be taken in.The actors are all brilliant and buy totally into each episode - this is not Friends where each actor seems concerned with their screen time or making sure that they look great! Would a Brian or a Mike fit into Friends - but I do know that 5 minutes in Spaced would have Jennifer Anniston in tears.Overall this is a excellent series - continually hilarious, very clever, very imaginative and a wonderful example of British TV. Showing in the Friday night slot after Friends on Ch 4 - this simply shows most US sitcoms up to be the shallow mass produced gloss that they are. Wonderful!"

      "title": "I FOUND SPACED SIMPLY Hysterical!.",
      "content": "This show is one of the most influential comedies of all time. It's definitely my favorite sitcom ever! As the title of this review suggests, Spaced is (at this moment in time) my personal favorite sitcom of all time. The characters, the situations and the filming is / are brilliant and the lifestyle the show focuses on will probably be quite a good prediction of what my life will be like immediately after University life ends. The characters are comic creations of real life and the situations are on the ridiculous side of real life, occasionally falling over into absolute madness, but in a very good way. It is the ultimate fan boys show - there are hundreds of nods to other TV shows and brilliant films and you can tell that the writers are just as huge fans of quality entertainment as most of the fans of Spaced are. The music is inspired. Although some aspects of the show look slightly dated already (even though it was filmed from 1999 to 2001) it is well worth discovering if you've never watched an episode. Also the second series is better than the first and just as fresh as the first series. The characters are developed further and the direction and stylistic features are even more sharp than the first series. The main characters (Tim and Daisy) are great, and the characters of Mike, Brian, Marsha and...Tyres (I LOVE HIM) are wonderful in supporting roles, and provide much of the comedy. If you've seen Shaun of the Dead and you haven't seen Spaced, you're missing out. You will love it."

      "title": "If you were born between 1970 and 1980...",
      "content": "...this is the show for YOU.It's hilarious on many different levels, ranging from the ultra-obscure comic book/film/TV/music references to the downright slapstick.The much-celebrated references may cause you to roll around on the sofa clutching your stomach laughing, or they may pass you by. It really doesn't matter. The programme is also incredibly touching. The writing and performances bring the paint-by-numbers characters (self-pitying cartoonist, lazy would-be journalist, tortured artist, drunken landlady, vain self-appointed fashion guru, weapons-obsessed idiot) to painfully vivid life, and no matter how cynically you may approach \"Spaced\" you will end up caring about these people and their relationships. But hey, even if you don't, there's still the pop-culture references to cling onto.From Tim fantasising playing \"Resident Evil 2\" and blasting zombies in his living room (before reality takes hold), Daisy seeing herself in the future in true \"The Shining\" style, and Marsha seeing how she might have been had she not turned to drink and rock stars, you'll start laughing and you won't stop.In fact, it doesn't matter what age you are, you will identify with the characters and you will care about them and you will laugh with them. A lot.Which just leaves the evil hidden agenda behind the series: watch it, listen to the audio commentary on the DVD and it becomes clear that they will make you watch Evil Dead 2. Before you know it, grandmothers will be watching notorious horror films and LAUGHING.For that alone we should be truly thankful."

      "title": "Another Bloody Classic",
      "content": "This program is definitely another program of it's time. In the late 1990's and the early part of the Millennium Channel 4 had what was it's most fertile time with regards to producing situation comedies for all tastes. Amongst them were That Peter Kay Thing, Phoenix Nights, Father Ted and Black Books. But through all this there came Spaced with its touching tale of two flat mates and their strange assortment of friends living within the same house in London. But this was not the only winning formula that they had in there. There was also the film/television/art/theatre references which were sometime very surreal but they tapped into the post modern world we live in and highlighted certain statements by media guru's that say that there isn't anything original anymore.Tim and Daisy meet one another in a café whilst they are separately flat hunting. A mad scheme as posing as a professional couple helps secure a flat from drink fuelled landlady who turns out to be one their closet friends. Also living in the house is Brian an artist whose work displays Anger, Pain, fear and aggression. Then there is Tim's best friend from childhood Mike who is an army fanatic who has been kicked out of the reserve army for trying to invade Paris with a tank. Daisy's friend manifest herself in the form of Twist a fashion guru that works in laundrette. These wonderful characters are supported by their comedy contemporaries. We have Bill Bailey, Ricky Gervais, Michael Smiley as the brilliant Tyres, and Reece Shearsmith as an angry soldier.Like Shaun of the dead Spaced is very well written. Pegg and Jessica Stevenson make an excellent writing team. Each episode is skillfully written and each holds a lot of memorable moments. My favourite episodes are Epiphanies and Help which features the wonderful character that is Tyres played to perfection by Michael Smiley. Another favourite episode is when Tim and Daisy act out a shoot out to escape the clutches of an angry mob. Certainly not been done before to such a devastating comic effect.Also there is the director Edgar Wright who to my knowledge has cemented himself as one of Britains most talented television directors with his fast camera moves. With out his creative input to this show each episode would have had fantastic script but it's final presentation would have been very boring and it would not have been as interesting or exciting.If you want a quality TV Show that reflects modern day pop culture of the late 90's and early noughties then this intelligent comedy drama is for you. If you don't then leave it alone well alone. Definitely a classic 9 out of 10"

      "title": "SPACED is Out of Sight!",
      "content": "SPACED is a wonderfully written and terrifically acted British comedy. Much of the creative team went on to do the great SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Simon Pegg & Jessica Stevenson have such great give and take, such chemistry - they are a delight. The show is just funny - that's all it tries to do - yes the characters become three-dimensional and you care about them - but the pace of the show is so fast, so brisk, with tons of pop culture references - but the pace is like a runaway train (in a good way) and in the long one, Spaced just tries to make you laugh and they succeed. Little moments between friends, buddies hanging out in front of the TV - this is the kind of stuff the show nails - where you, the viewer, go - that is just like me and my mates when we were just hanging out. The rest of the cast is top notch and the actress who plays the older landlady, Marsha - is brilliant. American TV has bought the rights to this (sadly) and have butchered it twice in pilot form - I hope it never reaches the US screens in its \"Americanized\" version - where I am sure they will take all the rough edges off and give the typical US TV notes - \"we have to like them - we want them to be good at their jobs.\" \"Well, they don't really have jobs.\" \"What??? That won't do.\""

      "content": "A brilliantly British series and one of the early signs of Pegg and Frost's perfect partnership. Written by Pegg and Hynes, they are obviously the perfect fit for the messy couple/non-couple leads. The surrounding characters all bring their own flavour and are again perfectly cast.The humour maybe wouldn't extend to all audiences, with frequent references to popular and 'geek' culture from the turn of the millenia, but for it's niche audience it is perfect.A semi-structured arc across episodes, with regular callbacks, but really each episode has it's own distinct and daft plot. The quality does dip on a couple occasions but for the most part it's consistent. A very easy, enjoyable watch."

All I can say is \"Roll on series 3\"!!!"
