      "content": "Cowboy Bebop is a series that should need no introduction to anime fans. However, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it's basically about space bounty hunters set to an old time jazz music soundtrack with plenty of classy old time stories and dark morals along the way. If you like action, space, jazz, or comedy, you may like Cowboy Bebop. If you like old time bounty hunter, private eye, or detective movies, you'll probably like Cowboy Bebop. If you like dark stories with twists that really make you feel for the characters, you'll like Cowboy Bebop. This is one series you don't have to be an anime fan to appreciate, but you have to be willing to give it a fair chance.A single episode of Cowboy Bebop packs more punch than several entire anime series I know of. If you're not a fan of the show by the end of episode one alone, you probably won't be. The characters are as real as any old time bounty hunter / detective movie, and every bit as interesting. The sci-fi space twist doesn't take away from the show in the slightest, it adds much. A good way of thinking about the show is Lupin the 3rd mixed with Outlaw Star, with more depth. With episode titles like Asteroid Blues, Honky Tonk Woman, Waltz for Venus, and Jupiter Jazz, the space, class, and jazz heavy style is quite apparent from the beginning. This isn't just some theme slapped on top of an anime, rather a critical part of the show.The characters are well rounded and all very interesting. Unlike a lot of anime, there is no annoying character you wish they would have left out. Each character is given equal importance, though the show centers on the bounty hunter Spike.Spike describes himself as an \"old fashioned cowboy.\" He spends a lot of the series searching for someone he once knew, I'll avoid details so I don't spoil anything. He could be a master thief if he so choose, his dexterity and fighting skills are nearly unmatched. With a good 'whatever' attitude, he's great fun to watch.Jet is more of an old time detective. He's the owner of the ship \"Bebop\", and best friend of Spike. He does his fair share in bounty hunting like Spike, mostly gathering information and providing backup to Spike.Faye is pretty much the anime embodiment of the women from detective movies. A fiercely materialistic woman, she does whatever it takes to get what she wants. She's not against stealing from anyone or using anyone to get it, then leaving them cold. An incredible bounty hunter in her own right, she joins the team without invitation or welcome. Much hilarious bickering and bounty thefts come between Faye and Spike from the outset.Ed is a hacker genius girl who joins the group after a promise from Faye to get information. They try to leave her dry after they get what they need. but Ed's hacking skills make that impossible. She's often comic relief, and may be insane. Who can tell? In any case, when hacking or computer skills are needed, Ed is there. When not needed, she's. still there, being a hilarious pain in the neck. She's often with Ein, a seemingly ordinary mutt that gets picked up along the way with a few not so hidden talents.In any case, Cowboy Bebop is a series anyone should watch. It has some language, a lot of violence, and some dark stories, but nothing that any kid these days hasn't seen a hundred times over. Even if you're not a bounty hunter or jazz fan, give this series a shot. Don't be surprised if you start to take a liking to jazz music or Yoko Kanno's amazing music. Congrats to Cartoon Network for bringing over the incredible dub, but check out the sub if possible. Enjoy. I refuse to end this rant with that catchy ending of each episode. Sorry. ^_^Rirath_com"

      "title": "Superbly styled anime",
      "content": "Cowboy Bebop should need no introduction; it's more than a uniquely defining series on several levels. Shinichi Watanabe crafted this mostly episodic anime with a beautiful plot arc that doesn't detract a bit from any moment in the series.Following the misadventures of a crew of unlikely bounty hunters through the future solar system, Bebop liberally dabbles in jazz, both the music and the attitude. The lead character, Spike Spiegel, is as much an antihero in the anime tradition as he would be in a Hemingway novel- witty and gutsy, with a twist of nihlistic worldview. Along with Spike, each part of the ensemble main cast do more than enough to stand out on their own, with perfectly human qualities. Jet Black, the gruff pilot, is truly epitomized in the episode \"Ganymede Elegy,\" where he confronts an old flame. Ed and Ein, the genius teenage hacker and her supersmart Corgi dog, throw the limits of standard comic relief out the window. And who could forget Faye Valentine, the eat-your-heart-out sprite of a woman with pizazz, flair, and a penchant for gambling.If you're not a fan of anime because of its tendency to be far-fetched and downright weird at times, Bebop is the right starter series for you. A melodrama, a jazzy jam session, and a sci-fi detective thriller all wrapped into a tight, upbeat package. Superb."

      "content": "Animation and anime I have loved for as long as I can remember, and Cowboy Bebop is one of the greatest examples of anime at its best. Everything about this show is exemplary. The animation is just wonderful, right from the detailed character designs, beautiful and haunting colours and the ethereal backgrounds to the coupling of the dazzling action and some of the most jaw-dropping futuristic spectacle in animation or otherwise known to man. The music stays in your mind for a long time and not in an irritating sense, always fits with the drama and shows complexity in mood and orchestration even with its very jazzy feel. Cowboy Bebop also displays some really fine writing, it is poignant and intense yet also humorous and thoughtful, and balanced without any qualms at all. The storytelling shows evidence of great ideas thoroughly and entertainingly explored with little too dark or too light-hearted, there is an ideal combination of both. The characters are interesting and not revolved around clichés, these characters especially Spike are well-developed and any person watching the show would relate to them. The voice work is very dynamic. In conclusion, an outstanding show in every aspect, don't miss it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

      "title": "Every good movie you've ever seen in one show.",
      "content": "Cowboy Bebop is a truly post-modern show. Not in the tired \"Scream\" sense of self-awareness, but in its willingness to mix genres and blur boundaries. At the most basic level it's a Space Western. But Bebop is not content to be merely that, so there are added dashes of film noir, gothic horror, creature-feature, black comedy, screwball comedy, spy action, crime, romance, tragedy, action, philosophy, science, spirituality, fatalism, optimism, buddy-buddy stories, slapstick humour, parody-- just about every type of tale under the sun appears in some shape or form during Bebop's run. It's a show where each episode really is different from the last. Were it not for the recurring characters, it would be hard to believe that the brightly-coloured blaxploitation parody \"Mushroom Samba\" could possibly come from the same series as the bleakly violent \"Real Folk Blues\".The world that the series inhabits is distinctly post-modern, too; space ships fly through hyperspace gates, but once on the ground their pilots fight with twentieth-century handguns. Scenic bays would look for all the world like they were taken from modern-day Japan were they not dwarfed by Jupiter, the enormous gas giant looming in the sky like some enormous benevolent god.And the music - tribal drums and chants give way to electronic pulses that give way to jazz sax and trumpets that give way to rock guitars that give way to blues harmonicas... composer Yoko Kanno faultlessly turns her hand to an eclectc selection of genres and instruments, ably backed up by her band, \"Seatbelts\".All of which sounds terribly impressive, but why on Earth should you watch it? Because, buddy, it's one of the finest television shows ever made.I have to admit I'm not a big anime fan. Most anime that makes it over here seems to be either about schoolgirls with supernatural powers who battle evil, or adolescent boys who - for some convoluted reason - wind up having to pilot big giant robots. And whilst I'm assured that shows such as Escaflowne (schoolgirls and magic) and Evangelion (boys and robots) are actually rather good, they completely fail to get my blood pumping. Enter Bebop. Ultra cool Spike, grumpy strategist Jet, trigger-happy Faye, nutball Ed and intelligent dog Ein are as far away from the usual brats and bots anime as you can possibly get. Their motivation, too, is far from the usual anime fare. These guys aren't bounty hunters because they want to fight crime and keep the peace - all they want is a wad of cash, and bounty hunting seems like the best place to make big money fast. Although they will do the right thing when pressed, they rarely forget their true motivation - and if they do, their perpetual lack of food will soon remind them. Life isn't easy, and when you're a bounty hunter it's even harder.Not that the crew of the spaceship Bebop are one-note characters. As the series progresses, our initial assumptions about the characters are overturned. At first Spike appears to be the cliched laid-back slacker (who just happens to be a mean jeet-kun-do fighter), but we then learn of his fall from the criminal underworld and of a loss that killed him emotionally. Jet's the obvious gruff authority figure, until we realise that he actually cares for the crew of the Bebop as if they were his kids (and seems to have dabbled in pot and psychadelic drugs when he was a teenager). Faye's the usual feisty stand-offish female lead but only because her amazingly tragic past makes her push away friends for fear that she'll become attached to them. Ed's just some nutty kid until we meet her crazy father and realise that it could well be her deprived childhood that sent her over the edge. And Ein? Well sometimes it's hard being a super intelligent Welsh Corgi on a ship where nobody appreciates you, you know?But not every episode is deathly serious - the character development is mixed in perfectly with humour (both light and dark), fistfights, shoot-outs, car chases, aerial fights, space battles and some of the lushest animation you'll see in an animated TV series. And all of this spread over only 26 episodes.Yes, many people espouse the old \"leave 'em wanting more\" line, but so few of them actually do it; Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the perfect example of a series that spends three or four years being top-notch TV then freefalls due to apparent apathy from both the cast and writers. Bebop avoids this by wrapping every dangling plot thread up in just one season of television. And after the final jaw-dropping episode it's quite clear that the series is most definitely over.Never before or since have I seen a series of such astonishing variety, intelligence and style. Ten out of ten."

      "content": "Cowboy Bebop will break any prejudgement you've ever had on anime. Simply put, the show is amazing. From the art, to the music, and most importantly, the story line - Cowboy Bebop delivers. Although most reviewers have summed up the storyline fairly well, I'll give a brief overview.In the not so distant future, many planets have been colonized and huge technological advancements have been made, but enough with the obvious. Two men, Spike and Jet meet up with future comrades Faye and Ed and team up (or fly it solo) to form the most effective bounty hunting team in the universe. Technology benefits both bounty hunter (known as Cowboys) and criminal as the crew of the Bebop Ship try to make an honest Wulong (the futuristic form of currency) while each member encounters shades of their illuminous past.A huge bondship amongst the characters is felt almost from the start, despite on-going tensions on the Bebop. Furthermore, each character is given at least two whole episodes, which elaborate on their past, which intertwines oddly with the present (an on-going theme in Cowboy Bebop).Their pasts are as diverse as their personalities and at some points you'll have a hard time even figuring out who the main character is. One is a former worker of a crime syndicate, one a former police officer, one a thief, and the last a computer hacker. Some similarities do exist though, namely stylish outfits and attitudes, but even then, these similarities are VERY few. The coolest thing about Cowboy Bebop is it's ability to give you something drastically different each session (don't call it an episode, it's a session). Some sessions wrap you up in action, some make you cry, still some sessions will make you roll on the ground in laughter. One thing for sure is you will get a very satisfying feeling once the credits hit.The soundtrack for the entire series is another high point. Virtually each session is entangled in some form of sophisticated music, usually Jazz, which is a welcome breeze from the stagnation of today's modern music.Compared to other anime, Bebop reigns supreme (along with a couple of others), and puts kids shows like Dragon Ball Z (which are virtually plotless in the light of Cowboy Bebop) to shame. This is definitely worth viewing if you're looking for something new to watch, but worried you might just fall victim to another piece of trash reality show or sitcom. Your previous conceptions of anime are about to be shattered."

An incredible sound track - Yoko Kanno is a genius that can do memorable and emotional jazz, blues, classical, fantasy-style, j-pop and even heavy metal. I wouldn't even consider buying the soundtrack to any other anime.It quite literally oozes \"cool\" - characters (Spike is probably the coolest - not awsomest, but stylishly coolest) music, action and narrative.Hell, it's the only show that has both a \"cute animal\" character and a \"cute annoying kid\" character that I don't wish a horrible death upon.

I have no idea what I was expecting and the hype probably did me in. I see the similarities to FIREFLY (they're often compared), but this wasn't nearly as watchable.But I'm not blind and can see that this is a well-made series. It's got great visuals (man, those establishing shots are something), great bluesy atmosphere, and attention to real firearms. The American voice cast seemed like good matches for their characters and I like that the Bebop crew just sorta fell in, no contrived reasons. And let me also just say that the music on this series was phenomenal, and enough for me to sell out the soundtrack. This show really had the knack for sneaking up behind you with a character's backstory. A session will proceed at its customary leisurely pace and then *bam!*, you just learned something major. The pacing did throw me off; here you have characters who are fluent in gunplay and piloting spaceships, and most of the time they're sitting back and talking. It was odd. The ending was also rather rushed for the same reason.I suspect a rewatch further down the road will change my mind on this. I certainly haven't given up as things like this tend to bug me. I'm the last guy to throw around \"overrated\", and that certainly doesn't apply here. But I do want to see what others do in this show.7/10"

These didn't bother me because they were used tastefully, and were balanced by action shots that carried a lot of energy.The voice acting for the english version is great, and adds to character depth. They seem to understand who the characters are and how they would react.The story line is interesting. With each episode being around 25 minutes, the time is filled with a balanced blend of action, character development, and plot. The story within an episode develops rapidly, while the whole series moves more slowly, with the exception of the last few episodes (where they were trying to wrap things up).If you've never tried any anime, this would be my first choice. I watched it on DVD, and would definitely watch it again."

It has its share of comical scenes, but it seamlessly integrates them into a web of other predominant emotions; drama, action, thriller, suspense...Cowboy Bebop is the epitome of cool and intelligent anime. An art I thought had long since been forgotten.You will enjoy the witty dialog as well as the action scenes, dramatic sequences, and most of all the incredible musical integration; jazz and other cultural music that allows for an incredibly open palette of emotions as you view the action on the screen. (Expect the unexpected.)The voices they chose to play the dubbed, English version of the Original series couldn't have been planned better. It strays from the stereotypical high-pitched whiney and otherwise annoying voices that usually plague a good anime port. Not this one. The roles are taken seriously and were performed VERY well.This series is definitely speaking to an older audience, something rare in ported/dubbed anime series these days. I am grateful for having the opportunity to experience this wonderful masterpiece.Cowboy Bebop is, by definition, art."

      "content": "After 30 years of watching Anime both here and in Japan, I'm long since over deciding whether something is 'good Anime' or not. I'm kind of just looking if this is something that's just good. Why are (most) Miyazaki movies good? Because they're not just Miyazaki movies, they're just well made and well told stories. Good is good, regardless of the medium.Cowboy Bebop came out of nowhere for a lot of western audiences, but it shouldn't have. Bebop was always built from the ground up as a riff on western themes chewed up and recooked Japanese style. It's not much different than the cycle of Jidaigeki Samurai movies from the 50s and on. Kurosawa and his contemporaries told their own 'westerns' and then the west just took those and remade them again. That's what Bebop is. It's not sci-fi, it's not action, it's not Blade Runner, it's not a western. But yeah it sort of is.It's also not that good. I know people worship this thing like Amon Ra, but there's just not much going on in most of the episodes. I ran through all this back in college when it hit stateside and there's a handful of mood pieces here worth note, but the series at large is really just a statement about futility. And I never really felt it earned it, plus it's pretty boring. Spike is cool as heck - I love this guy - but just about everything else here save some beats, is definitely 'Anime standard'. The storytelling quality is pretty sophomoric. The ideas are there, but Bebop doesn't really take them anywhere.Spike's malaise certainly connects with so many people, I get that, but best 'Anime' ever? Hardly. Even if it was, that's small potatoes - the best 'Anime' transcends the genre to be good for good. The Netflix remake wasn't any better, but that's the point really. The only good part of the show was John Cho because really, the only good part of the OG was Spike. This one is just not that good either."

I didn't find a lot of thrills in many of the single episode. Still, there were still episodes that were exciting and made me think about the message of the show. There was an overarching story, but I would prefer that there were more times dedicating to this main story.Of course the best thing about this show was the music. The opening was for sure one the best. It was so cool and definitely got me excited. Then, the music within the show was just as dope and create a unique vibe to each episode. This reminds me a bit of Megalobox, which also has fun and variable genres of songs.The four main characters had great chemistry with each other and created comedic moments. They also each had interesting backstories, but the show revealed little, more like a quick glimpse, of each character, and I can't help but desire more. Eh maybe that's not the point of the show.Overall, I enjoyed part of the show, mainly for its music and entertaining characters. 7/10."

      "content": "'Cowboy Bebop' is probably one of the best known anime series; I know I'd heard of it long before I started watching anime. Given that it is surprising how long I took getting around to watching it but as it was out of print I had little choice. Once it was reissued I got it as soon as I could and enjoyed it from start to finish. Just in case you don't know the series follows bounty hunters Spike Spiegel, Jet black and their ship the Bebop as they chase their bounties across the solar system. Along the way they are joined by fellow bounty hunter, the sexy Faye Valentine, a girl called Edward who is a genius with computers and Ein the dog. Over the course of the series we learn more about the characters as we watch them going after a variety of bounties; many of them dangerous and all of them entertaining.I had seen Cowboy Bebop: The Movie before watching the series and must say I prefer the series; it is more stylish with its jazz soundtrack and wide variety of stories. Being twenty six episodes long there is time to learn the characters back stories which makes them more likable. This series has one of the best casts of any I can think of; they are all cool in their own way. While it is primarily a drama there is also a fair bit to laugh at in many episodes without those laughs seeming forced. I watched the series in Japanese with English subtitles and thought it sounded good; I had heard that it also had a good English sound track so re-watched one episode dubbed and must say I was quite impressed."

      "title": "An exceptionally well-done anime.",
      "content": "I'm not a big fan of anime. When I hear that word I think of Cartoon Network, of the overly wordy internal monologues from 'Speed Racer,' of the pseudo-interesting transformation scenes from 'Sailor Moon,' of one person rushing at another from what appears to be several hundred yards away in 'Dragonball Z,' of convoluted plots and robots that pull mile-long guns out of thin air in 'Gundam 0083.' It's all overly ridiculous, and in their attempts to look 'cool' a lot of animes instead end up looking stupid.So boy was I surprised when I first saw 'Cowboy Bebop.'I'm still in the process of watching all 26 episodes, so I don't know everything about the series, but from what I've seen, it's head-and-shoulders better than any anime out there.It's a fairly simple premise: around 2020 there was a weird explosion which took out part of Luna and put moon rocks in orbit around Earth in a miniature asteroid belt. Earth was rendered more or less uninhabitable, but the same weird explosion also held the keys to Hyperspace Gates, a safe and reliable form of transportation which the planetless Earthlings used to colonize their solar system. With this expansion came an explosion in the Mafia, the black market, the criminal underworld; to control it, InterStellar Space Police was created. But even the ISSP wasn't enough, and so the Police began to put out bounties on criminals. A subculture of bounty hunters evolved; best estimates suggest that there are over 300,000 in the Sol system alone. They have revived and adopted an ancient title: \"Cowboy.\"'Cowboy Bebop' focuses on the travels of bounty hunter Spike Spiegel, a tall, lanky martial artist who oozes more style than Baz Luhrmann. He and his partner Jet Black travel the solar system in their ship, the Bebop (hence the title of the show), tracking down bounties and entertaining their audiences again and again. But it's not entirely accurate to say that the show FOCUSES on Spike and Jet, because there are two main characters who join the show in later episodes--Faye Valentine, a sexy, outrageous woman with a shadowed past and no tact (and a wardrobe that the animators seem to enjoy making look like it might fall off at any given moment) and a bizarre 13-year-old girl named Ed (don't ask) who can basically hack into any computer system and provides surreal comic relief on the side. But it's not entirely accurate to say the show focuses on THEM, either, because the star is undeniably Spike. The show starts and ends with his past. What about that past? Ah, but that would be telling.In a medium where characters routinely jump fifty feet into the air and then produce huge beams of energy from somewhere, CB's realism is welcome and refreshing. The animation is fluid and subtle--watching Spike fist-fight the week's bounty in the premier episode is a sight to behold. It's obvious that the animators have put a lot more thought into realistic movement than they normally do. These cel-bound wonders are mixed with a sprinkling of CGI that would do Babylon 5 proud. All together, it creates a visually appealing mix, made even more endearing by the fact that the laws of physics evidently still apply. Despite his extensive martial arts training, Spike produces no energy beams, makes no Matrix-esque leaps, and more or less keeps his feet planted on the earth, the same as the series does.Characters are handled exquisitely. With only four characters and 26 episodes to deal with, it's a little easier to keep everything vigorous and interesting, but it's still refreshing to see CB using ALL of its characters in EVERY episode--and generally managing to develop them all too. I know of NO television series where every episode manages to add something new to every character. Frankly, I don't think there is one. That alone says something about CB's quality.Finally, we have the music. It's no coincidence that the show is named after a style of music, and composer Yoko Kanno has created over three hours worth of lush, diverse, interesting music for the series. In a medium where music is created, thrown away on a weekly basis, and generally only exists to warn the viewer that something significant is going to happen, Cowboy Bebop uses its soundtrack to maximum effect. I've only seen eleven episodes, but I can already point to three or four moments when the music absolutely MAKES the scene, and I've probably missed more.One thing I should say--Cowboy Bebop, like most animes, isn't really meant as commentary or satire. It is not intended to be socially relevant, to present controversial themes, to make viewers sit up and re-evaluate their lives. It is simply intended to entertain--and that it does. The stories it tells are not unique, but the way they are told is. Strong animation is combined with incredible storytelling and extraordinary music to create an anime unlike any other. One anime reviewer suggested that Cowboy Bebop will be the first of a new genre. This may not be accurate, but it tells you exactly how different and interesting this particular show is."

      "title": "I Didn't Love It. Uh Oh!",
      "content": "Cowboy Bebop is one of the most acclaimed anime out there, especially since it was an early introduction for many fans. Its been running on Adult Swim for a freaking decade! By the time I was watching Saturday night anime, it was only on late. The two episodes I did watch didn't impress me.Now that I'm older and wiser, I thought I could appreciate it more. Perhaps those two episodes were flukes. But alas, this series just isn't for me. There is some fun action, and the animation is among the best. I love the detailed, realistic sci-fi machinery, settings, and backgrounds. They pulled me halfway through the series before I quit.But the character and plot of Cowboy Bebop are pretty shallow. The episodes are individual vignettes, so strong writing and characters are needed to hold them up. Instead, we have two-dimensional good guys hunting down one-dimensional bad guys. Our main cast barely develops, even with a few memories pulled up. They're fun, but they get boring after a dozen episodes. As for the side-characters, half of the them are stereotypical thugs, and most of the rest did not have enough time, depth, or personality to connect with me. Plot-wise, I almost always thought \"It was alright\" instead of \"Wow, that was amazing!\"When I first started, I was pretty pumped up. Then I was mildly interested. Then I relegated it to background noise. I have never given an anime more of a chance. I can see why people love it, but I don't see how its well-written. Even at its best, I only thought it was okay. But apparently, that isn't enough, considering even respectful, 5/10 reviews are getting a barrage of downvotes. If sci-fi action + jazz is enough for you, then its fine. But I wouldn't even place it on the Top 100."

      "title": "Good looking sci-fi action series",
      "content": "This series was once voted the greatest anime series of all time, and so any criticism of it is likely to incur the ire of its many devoted fans. For me, though, this series was sort of the Miami Vice of anime - very long on cinematic style and flashy visuals and very influential, but pick it apart and you will find that the underlying structure is weaker than you first thought, at least in the early going. The science fiction details are well thought through and the animation direction is very good overall, but when you start looking at story structure and character, the level of originality drops sharply. The first four episodes have basically the same story line - the bounty hunting main characters go after a fugitive only to find that he has stolen something top secret that other people want and are willing to double cross the bounty hunters over. In the fifth episode we find that one of the main characters used to be an enforcer for the mob. How novel. Okay, this probably sounds worse than it is.Beyond this point, quite fortunately, the story line breaks away from the formula to explore more of the universe of Cowboy Bebop and how the characters relate to it, all of which is a plus. The show's incredible visual sense, with a great many wonderful science fiction ideas thrown out often in passing and glimpsed but never in other than purely visual terms, and this continues, while the story framework gets more ambitious. More of Earth and why humans spread out into the solar system is examined as is how the crew of the Bebop came together and where they are headed. Love, regret, revenge are introduced and added skillfully to the mix. The storytelling is assured and varied and a strong emotional atmosphere hangs over everything as characters examine their choices, and their motives and wonder where they are headed. But even then, it's long on cool and short on depth. There is a lot of music in the series - jazz, blues, heavy metal - in fact many of the shows have a thematic music style, and this is a plus, but the resulting music video montages, once again elevate superficial style over dramatic substance. It's a really cool series to look at. With less of a formula approach, especially in the early going, it might be a perfect one."

I'm not very much into anime ,but I think that you don't need to be a anime fan to enjoy this show . First of all ,it takes place in a futuristic society ,but with film -noir /contemporary drama elements , and you could appreciate it in the music and the visual elements . The scenery have very much details ,and are very similar to the modern cities like new York . The music it's more than appropriate with many different rhythms ,all adequate with the spirit of the show . The characters are likable and mysterious , and all have a dramatic story behind them . Of course ,there are many funny parts that work very well ,and there are gags that made me laugh a lot . Even when this series it's too short (just 26 episodes) it have very much to offer . Some people consider it the best anime ever made .And it have enough merits to deserve that title ."

The soundtrack has some of the best jazz tracks ever written for a series. Even the full length movie is a must watch. If you want to get your feet wet in the world of anime, there is no better sci-fi/pulp fiction take than Cowboy Bebop."

The soundtrack is great, the animation aged like wine, and the main characters (besides Edward and Ein) were great with how they addressed their pasts. The best episodes were the ones that revolved around the character's pasts (which should have been all of them). I've noticed that the people who call this a masterpiece either haven't seen another anime, watched this when it came out (nostalgia), or are infatuated with episodic style shows. It's not that deep. Most episodes are forgettable with cliche and contrived antagonists; only the episodes dealing with the main cast are good. Honestly, this was just better than the other animes at that time."

Edward wasn't in the show for that long but I still felt the pain of when she left. Sure, this story was hard to follow at times and I found myself playing it in the background. To say, however, that this show was bad would be a big disgrace. I can see why people hyped this show up because it really is that good and it gives you real life lessons. I just found some episodes hard to care about . Some could be highly suspenseful while others fell flat or repetitive. I do love how it's episodic, it's a nice show to watch when you're bored. I'll give it a 7/10, it did take me a while to finish watching but I don't regret it. I definitely recommend."
