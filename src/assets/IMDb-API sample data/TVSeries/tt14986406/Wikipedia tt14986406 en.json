It is revealed that 12th Division captain <span>Mayuri Kurotsuchi</span> ordered his division to exterminate the civilians from the Rukon District, in order to rectify the soul imbalance caused by the Quincies exterminating Hollows in the Living World. It is revealed that Yamamoto failed to stop Yhwach 1000 years ago. Quilge absorbs Reishi in the area (including from Ayon) and overpowers the Tres Bestias, but clashes with Ichigo once again after he activates his Bankai, all the while the Quincies have begun their invasion of the Soul Society, with Bazz-B mortally wounding Lieutenant of Squad 3 Izuru Kira and brutally killing the seat officers of Squad 3.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep370\" style=\"text-align:center\">370</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Kill The Shadow\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Hikaru Murata</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Hikaru Murata</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Tomohisa Taguchi</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">November 1, 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #AE1C28\">Over 1000 Soul Reapers die within the Quincy's invasion. 3rd Division captain Rōjūrō \"Rose\" Ōtoribashi meets Stern Ritter \"U\" NaNaNa Najahkoop, 6th Division captain <span>Byakuya Kuchiki</span> and lieutenant <span>Renji Abarai</span> against Stern Ritter \"F\" Äs Nödt and Stern Ritter \"S\" Mask De Masculine, 7th Division captain, and <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Sajin Komamura</span> on Stern Ritter \"E\" Bambietta Basterbine.

The captains are shocked of the news that the Stern Ritters' trump card is to steal Bankai, as it is communicated to the rest of the Soul Society. 8th Division captain, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Shunsui Kyōraku</span> is blinded in his right eye by Robert Accutrone. Meanwhile, Quilge continues his fight against Ichigo and Urahara observes that the Stern Ritter is having difficulties stealing Ichigo's Bankai. Urahara reveals the portal for Ichigo to enter there and join the fight. In a last ditch effort, Quilge attacks Urahara, Orihime and Sado, and uses his Stern Ritter powers (\"The Jail\") to imprison Ichigo, while he is in the Garganta and on his way to the Soul Society.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep371\" style=\"text-align:center\">371</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Wrath as a Lightning\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Mitsutoshi Sato</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Mitsutoshi Sato</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Masaki Hiramatsu</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">November 8, 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #AE1C28\">Ichigo hears the voices of many Soul Reapers, while desperately trying to escape from Quilge's Jail.

Byakuya attempts to overcome his fear, but Äs overwhelms him with his own Bankai. <span>Rukia</span> and Renji are wounded by other Stern Ritters. Zaraki, having killed three of them, confronts Yhwach and his right hand man, Jugram Haschwalth. As 9th division lieutenant <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Shūhei Hisagi</span> is about to be defeated by Stern Ritter \"O\", Driscoll Berci, head captain Yamamoto steps in.

Yhwach is powerless against the various abilities of Zanka no Tachi, and Yamamoto boasts that his Bankai is too strong to be stolen. Yamamoto unknowingly defeats the fake replica and identifies it as Stern Ritter \"Y- Yourself\" Royd Lloyd. Yhwach destroys the Division 1 barracks and kills Royd for his failure. Yhwach reveals he was busy meeting with <span>Sōsuke Aizen</span> in his underground prison. Considered by the Wandenreich to be one of the Five Special War Powers, Yhwach attempted to recruit Aizen, but he refused to join him, not wanting him to fall under his command, so he was left in prison.

Afterwards, Yamamoto adopted a peaceful philosophy and formed a unified Court Guard system. Back in the present day, Yhwach destroys Yamamoto's remains. Ichigo breaks free and Byakuya asks him to save everyone. Ichigo trades blows with Yhwach's Reishi Sword using Getsuga Tenshō, but is quickly defeated. Yhwach attempts to stab Ichigo in the neck, but is countered by a defensive Quincy technique called Blut Vene. Yhwach reveals Quilge's Jail can only be broken by a Quincy and deduces that Ichigo doesn't know the truth about himself or his mother. Shadow portals appear to transport the Quincy back to Silbern and Yhwach realizes that Aizen used his <i>shikai</i> on him to lose track of time.

Unohana and Zaraki fight in the infinite underground prison, Muken. Zaraki recalls how he used to admire Unohana, from their first meeting on, when he scarred her chest.

Back in the present day, Unohana wounds Zaraki hundreds of times, as he grows stronger each time he resurrects. She unleashes her Bankai, Minazuki, which allows her to extend her blade with acidic slashes resembling blood. Zaraki has grown strong enough to power through and kill her. As he grieves Unohana, he finally gets to speak with his Zanpakutō and forge bond. Meanwhile, Ichigo, Renji and Kon arrive in Nimaiya's palace, Hoohden, where they meet countless Zanpakutō spirits and the unconventional captain himself. Nimaiya teaches them about the basics of how Soul Reapers receive Zanpakutō in their base form, called Asauchi, which becomes a personalized Zanpakutō the more the wielder imprints his soul pressure on it. Nimaiya sends the two down into a hole filled with countless Asauchi and leaves them there for three days to fight them. Renji comes out victorious, with an Asauchi having chosen him, but Ichigo fails the test. Nimaiya unceremoniously sends Ichigo back to the Human World, right in front of the Kurosaki clinic, citing that he needs to return to his roots, since he did not go through traditional Asauchi training.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep377\" style=\"text-align:center\">377</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">11</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Everything But the Rain\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Mitsutoshi Sato</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Hikaru Murata,<br>Yūsaku Kikuchi</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Masaki Hiramatsu</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">December 20, 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #AE1C28\">Nimaiya tells Renji, that he created every single Zanpakutō for the last several thousand years, including Zaraki's, which he actually stole off of a Soul Reaper's dead body, adding that Ichigo's was not an Asauchi made by him, therefore his training would have never worked. Ichigo visits the shop, where Ikumi Unagiya comforts him, before <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Isshin Kurosaki</span> arrives in his Soul Reaper attire to take Ichigo away, though Ichigo unknowingly leaves his badge behind. Isshin tells Ichigo about the history of their family, while to Ichigo that his mother was a Quincy. Nearly twenty years ago, when Isshin Shiba was still captain of Division 10, a series of mysterious Soul Reaper deaths began occurring in Naraki City. Isshin went out to investigate the cause, which turned out to be an immensely powerful and intelligent Hollow, clad in black armor and made from the mixture of several dead Soul Reapers' souls, which is where it gets its name \"White\". Elsewhere, Masaki Kurosaki, an Echt Quincy noble who was taken in by Sōken Ishida's family after the demise of her own, sensed the Spiritual Pressure released by the Hollow and Isshin, and headed off to help, despite Ryūken and the lower ranked Gemischt Quincy family maid Kanae Katagiri attempting to dissuade her. While fighting the Hollow, Isshin attempted to use his Bankai, but was slashed in the back by the creators of this Hollow, Aizen, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Gin Ichimaru</span> and <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Kaname Tōsen</span>. Masaki arrived and saved Isshin, while Aizen stopped Tōsen from killing her, due to finding her intriguing. Masaki used herself as bait to draw the Hollow close and kill it in one blow, initiating its self destruction which Isshin shielded Masaki from. Masaki healed Isshin's wounds, while also revealing herself to be a Quincy. Initially fearing his reaction, she rejoiced, when Isshin gladly declared, that he was happy to have met a living Quincy. Ryūken and Kanae, seeing that she found safety, decided to leave her be and headed off together.

As she was berated by Ryūken's mother for helping a Soul Reaper, she collapsed and a hollow hole appeared on her chest. Ryūken picked her up and ran off for help, running into Isshin and blaming him for Masaki's condition. Urahara, who has briefly met with Masaki before, then stepped into their conflict and told them that he knows of a way to help her, which he discovered during the last one hundred years of exile, while trying to cure the Visoreds. Due to her being an extremely powerful Echt Quincy merged with a hollow, the solution for her cure would be different, than for a Soul Reaper merged with one. To balance her soul out with the hollow's in her, the entirety of a Soul Reaper's power is needed to combat it for her entire life, since a Quincy does not have any resistance to hollow souls. Isshin volunteered and Urahara provided him with a specially created Gigai, that can completely contain a Soul Reaper soul and turn them into a human. Afterwards, the two settled down together and fell in love, while Ryūken married Katagiri. Isshin then tells Ichigo, that the reason Masaki died fighting Grand Fisher and Katagiri died from her illness, was because according to ancient Quincy texts, Yhwach used the Auswählen that stripped several of his people of their powers to regain his own 9 years ago, deeming them impure. Before heading off again, Ichigo receives his badge back from Ikumi. Ryūken finds evidence of Uryū meeting with the Stern Ritters.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep379\" style=\"text-align:center\">379</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">13</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"The Blade Is Me\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Tomohisa Taguchi</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Tomohisa Taguchi,<br>Mitsutoshi Sato,<br>Yoshinori Odaka</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Masaki Hiramatsu</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">December 27, 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #AE1C28\">One of Nimaiya's Zanpakutō bodyguards immediately retrieves Ichigo and places him with the countless Asauchi again, to fight until one chooses him. However, all the Asauchi kneel to Ichigo as he chooses a white Asauchi, the hollow \"White\" inside him. In Soul Society, the captains and lieutenants begin training. Captain Hitsugaya returns to the Soul Reaper training grounds to hone his sword-wielding skills. 9th division captain, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Kensei Muguruma</span> takes his lietenant, Hisagi out to face his other, unofficial lieutenant Mashiro Kuna in her Hollowfied form, in order to awaken his Bankai. Akon returns to the division 12 barracks after his wounds have been treated and learns that captain Kurotsuchi and lieutenant <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Nemu Kurotsuchi</span> have locked themselves in the lab for more than 24 hours now and are in the process of creating something. Captain Komamura returns to his clan's hideout and tries to convince the clan elder to teach him a secret clan technique, while captain Soi-Fon trains her body in the mountains. Meanwhile, Nimaiya's bodyguards prepare the forge and he begins rebuilding Ichigo's Zanpakutō, while also telling him that Old Man Zangetsu is not his Zanpakutō, the hollow \"White\" in him was his Zanpakutō all along, and that Old Man Zangetsu was actually the source of Ichigo's latent Quincy powers, taking the form of Yhwach from a thousand years ago. Ichigo speaks to Old Man Zangetsu again, who expresses pride in how strong Ichigo has become since he chose the path of a Soul Reaper, despite Old Man Zangetsu suppressing his powers to prevent him from becoming a Soul Reaper in the first place. Old Man Zangetsu sheds a tear as he says farewell and relinquishes his hold on Ichigo's powers, allowing him to finally access his true Zanpakutō, the dual bladed Zangetsu. Sensing both \"White\" and Old Man Zangetsu in the long and short blades respectively, Ichigo thanks Zangetsu and says that you are me. In Silbern, Yhwach meets with Haschwalth, who has brought Uryū along, donned in Stern Ritter attire.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"13\" id=\"Part_2:_The_Separation\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color:#AE1C28;color:white\"><b>Part 2: <i>The Separation</i></b></td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:inherit\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep380\" style=\"text-align:center\">380</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">14</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\"><small style=\"color: #2C2C2C\" title=\"To be announced\">TBA</small></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><small style=\"color: #2C2C2C\" title=\"To be announced\">TBA</small></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><small style=\"color: #2C2C2C\" title=\"TBA\">TBA</small></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><small style=\"color: #2C2C2C\" title=\"TBA\">TBA</small></td><td style=\"text-align:center\">July 8, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><h3>Home media release</h3><h4>Japanese</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><caption><span>Aniplex</span> (Region 2, Blu-ray &amp; DVD)</caption><tbody><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Volume</th><th>Discs</th><th>Episodes</th><th>Release date</th><th width=\"5%\">Ref.</th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" width=\"1%\" style=\"background: #AE1C28;\"></td><td>I</td><td>2</td><td>1–13</td><td>April 26, 2023</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>"
