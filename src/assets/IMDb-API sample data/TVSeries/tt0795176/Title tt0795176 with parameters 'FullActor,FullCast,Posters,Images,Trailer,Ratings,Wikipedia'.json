David Attenborough returned as narrator and presenter. A second sequel, Planet Earth III is currently announced and planned to air in 2023.\r\nBackground\r\nIn 2001 the BBC broadcast The Blue Planet, a series on the natural history of the world's oceans. It received critical acclaim, high viewing figures, audience appreciation ratings, and many awards. It also became a hugely profitable global brand, eventually being sold to 150 countries worldwide. Feedback showed that audiences particularly liked the epic scale, the scenes of new and unusual species and the cinematic quality of the series. Programme commissioners were keen for a follow-up, so Alastair Fothergill decided that the Natural History Unit should repeat the formula with a series looking at the whole planet. The idea for Planet Earth was born, and the series was commissioned by Lorraine Heggessey, then Controller of BBC One, in January 2002.\r\nA feature film version of Planet Earth was commissioned alongside the television series, repeating the successful model established with The Blue Planet and its companion film, Deep Blue. Earth was released around the world from 2007 to 2009. There was also another accompanying television series, Planet Earth: The Future, which looked at the environmental problems facing some of the species and habitats featured in the main series in more detail.\r\nBroadcast\r\nPlanet Earth premiered on BBC One on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom. On the same day or in the subsequent weeks or months, the series also began airing in several other countries.\r\nInternational broadcasters carrying Planet Earth include Australia on ABC and GEM, Canada on CBC and CTV, New Zealand on Prime, the Philippines on GMA Network and GMA News TV, the U.S. on Discovery Channel, Velocity, Science, Animal Planet, Destination America and BBC America.\r\nBritish television\r\nThe episodes are each an hour in length, comprising the main programme and a 10-minute featurette called Planet Earth Diaries, which details the filming of a particular event. In the UK, Planet Earth was split into two parts, broadcast in spring and autumn 2006. The first five episodes premiered on BBC One at 9:00 pm on Sundays, beginning on 5 March 2006. The programmes were repeated the following Saturday in an early evening slot on BBC Two. Along with its 2005 dramatisation of Bleak House, the BBC selected Planet Earth for its trial of high-definition broadcasts. The opening episode was its first-ever scheduled programme in the format, shown 27 May 2006 on the BBC HD channel.\r\nThe first episode in the autumn series, Great Plains, received its first public showing at the Edinburgh International Television Festival on 26 August 2006. It was shown on a giant screen in Conference Square. The remaining episodes were broadcast from 5 November 2006 in the same primetime BBC One slot, following a further repeat run of the spring programmes on BBC Four. The autumn episodes were broadcast simultaneously on BBC HD and were repeated on BBC Four the following week.\r\nBesides being BBC One's featured One to Watch programme of the day, Planet Earth was heavily trailed on the BBC's television and radio channels both before and during its run. The music that was featured in the BBC trailers for the series is the track \"Hoppípolla\" from the album Takk... by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós. Following the advertisements, interest was so widespread that the single was re-released. In the United States, the series was promoted using \"The Time Has Come\" from trailer music company Epic Score, composed by Gabriel Shadid and Tobias Marberger. The Australian trailers initially used Jupiter: The Bringer of Jollity from Gustav Holst's orchestral suite The Planets, but later reverted to \"Hoppípolla\".\r\nInternational\r\nThe BBC pre-sold the series to several overseas broadcasters, including the Discovery Channel for the United States, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, China Central Television, WDR for Germany, Discovery Channel for India, Prime Television for New Zealand, and C1R for Russian broadcasts. The series was eventually sold to 130 countries.\r\nOn 25 March 2007, the series began its run on American television on the Discovery network, premiering on the Discovery Channel and Discovery HD Theater. There were a number of revisions to the original British programme. Actress and conservationist Sigourney Weaver was brought in to replace David Attenborough as narrator, as it was thought her familiarity to American audiences would attract more viewers. The Discovery programmes also used a slightly different script to the British original. The series was broadcast on Sundays in one 3-hour block followed by four 2-hour blocks. The Planet Earth Diaries segments were not shown immediately after each episode, but collectively in Planet Earth: The Filmmakers' Story, a two-hour special which was broadcast after the series had finished its initial network run. Edited versions were later broadcast on The Science Channel, Animal Planet, and Planet Green.\r\nIn Canada, the series did not air on the Canadian Discovery Channel, as it is owned by CTV and the Canadian rights were exclusively sold to the CBC.\r\nEpisodes\r\n\"A hundred years ago, there were one and a half billion people on Earth. Now, over six billion crowd our fragile planet. But even so, there are still places barely touched by humanity. This series will take you to the last wildernesses and show you the planet and its wildlife as you have never seen them before.\"— David Attenborough's opening narration\r\n\"Our planet is still full of wonders. As we explore them, so we gain not only understanding, but power. It's not just the future of the whale that today lies in our hands: it's the survival of the natural world in all parts of the living planet. We can now destroy or we can cherish. The choice is ours.\"— David Attenborough, in closing\r\nPlanet Earth: The Future\r\nThe latter episodes were supplemented by Planet Earth: The Future, a series of three 60-minute films that highlight the conservation issues surrounding some of the featured species and environments. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was Fergus Beeley. The series began transmission on BBC Four after the ninth episode, \"Shallow Seas\".\r\nFeature film\r\nAlongside the commissioning of the television series, BBC Worldwide and GreenLight Media secured financing for a US$15 million film version of Planet Earth. This followed the earlier success of Deep Blue, the BBC's 2003 theatrical nature documentary which used re-edited footage from The Blue Planet. The film was co-directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield and produced by Alix Tidmarsh and Sophokles Tasioulis. Only 30% of the footage shown in Earth is new, with the remainder being reworked from the television series to suit the narrative of the film. David Attenborough was replaced as narrator by high-profile actors: Patrick Stewart for the UK market and James Earl Jones for the United States.\r\nEarth had its worldwide premiere in September 2007 at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in San Sebastián, Spain, in Basque Country. Lionsgate released the film in several international markets over the following year. In the United States, it became the first film to be released by Disneynature, the Walt Disney Company's new nature documentary arm. When released on Earth Day 2009 it set the record for the highest opening weekend gross for a nature documentary, and went on to become the third highest grossing documentary of all time. It has grossed more than $108 million worldwide; in the nature documentary genre, only March of the Penguins has achieved greater box-office success.\r\nReception\r\nCritical reception\r\nPlanet Earth received widespread critical acclaim. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 95% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The critical consensus reads \"Planet Earth weaves innovative camera techniques and patient observation to deliver viewers an astounding glimpse of the world's perils and wonders, capturing jaw-dropping scenery and animals on both an epic and intimate scale.\" Time magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 New TV Series of 2007, ranking it at No. 4. In 2019, Planet Earth and its sequel were ranked 72nd on The Guardian's list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.\r\nAccolades\r\nPlanet Earth: From Pole to Pole won the Science and Natural History award at the Royal Television Society Programme Awards in 2007. The RTS also awarded it a Judge's Award and a Photography Award at its Craft and Design Awards. The series picked up two awards from the Broadcasting Press Guild for Best Documentary Series and Innovation in Broadcasting, and won Best Documentary Series at the 2007 Broadcast Awards. At the 2007 BAFTA Television Awards, Planet Earth was nominated in the Specialist Factual and Pioneer Audience Award categories, but lost out to Nuremberg: Goering's Last Stand and Life on Mars respectively. It received three nominations at the BAFTA Television Craft Awards later the same year. George Fenton's original score won him Soundtrack Composer of the Year at the 2007 Classical BRIT Awards. Planet Earth was also nominated for the NTA for Most popular Factual program but lost to Top Gear (Supernanny and Bad Lad's Army: Officer Class were also nominated).\r\nPlanet Earth was recognised by the American television industry, collecting the award for Nonfiction Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2007 and winning a further three prizes in technical categories at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. It also collected two awards from the Television Critics Association in Los Angeles in July 2007 and a Peabody Award in April 2008.\r\nThe series was also fêted at wildlife film festivals around the globe, collected multiple prizes at the Wildscreen Festival 2006, the International Wildlife Film Festival 2007 and the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival 2007.\r\nAwards and nominations\r\nAudience response\r\nThe credentials of the filmmakers, the size of the production, a high-profile marketing campaign and a primetime BBC One timeslot all resulted in Planet Earth attracting large audiences when it debuted in the UK in March 2006. The first episode, \"From Pole to Pole\", was watched by more people than any natural history programme since Attenborough and Fothergill's previous series, The Blue Planet, in 2001. The first five episodes drew an average audience of 11.4 million viewers, including the early evening repeats, outperforming even The Blue Planet. When the series returned to British screens after a six-month break, it remained popular but viewing figures did not reach the same levels. The final six episodes attracted an average audience of 6.8 million viewers, appreciably lower than the spring episodes, but still higher than BBC One's average for the timeslot. The BBC's 2007 Annual Report revealed that the series \"received the highest audience appreciation score of any British programme on TV this year\".\r\nIn the United States, Planet Earth drew equally impressive ratings when it premiered on Discovery and Discovery HD Theater on 25 March 2007. The first three episodes (screened back to back) averaged 5.72 million viewers with a peak of 6.07 million viewers, giving the network its third highest audience ever. It was also the most watched Discovery programme since The Flight That Fought Back in 2005.\r\nSequel\r\nIn February 2016, the BBC announced a six-part sequel had been commissioned, titled Planet Earth II, for release in late 2016, with Sir David Attenborough returning as narrator and presenter. As with the 2006 series, the trailer features the track 'Hoppipolla' by Icelandic group Sigur Ros.\r\nMerchandise\r\nThe popularity of the television series around the world translated into strong sales of associated Planet Earth merchandise. In the United States, it became the fastest and bestselling documentary DVD in Discovery Channel's history, and the high-definition (HD) discs generated US$3.2 million in sales in just two months. By the end of 2007, U.S. sales had topped 3 million units, making it the highest-grossing HD title and one of the top ten DVD titles of the year.\r\nIn addition, the brand was licensed to other companies to produce children's books, calendars, a board game, jigsaws, stationery, cards, and more.\r\nDVD\r\nA five-disc DVD box set of the complete series (BBCDVD1883) was released in the UK for Regions 2 and 4 (PAL) on 27 November 2006 by 2 entertain. It is presented in 5.1-channel Dolby Digital surround sound and 16:9 widescreen video. The bonus features include Planet Earth Diaries (presented immediately after each episode as for the original TV broadcast) and Planet Earth: The Future. In the United States, two versions of the same five-disc set were released as a Region 1 (NTSC) DVD on 24 April 2007. The BBC Warner release retained David Attenborough's narration from the original British television broadcasts, but the Discovery Channel edition used the alternative Sigourney Weaver voice-over. Even in the United States the Attenborough version was much the better for sales.\r\nHD DVD and Blu-ray\r\nExcept for a small amount of extremely hard-to-obtain footage, Planet Earth was filmed entirely in high-definition, and consequently became one of the first television series to take advantage of the new HD disc formats.\r\nThe series was released in both Blu-ray and HD DVD formats as a five-disc Region B box set on 12 November 2007. On the fifth disc, the bonus features from the standard-definition DVD set were replaced by two episodes from the BBC's Natural World series, \"Desert Lions\" and \"Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth\", both also presented in high-definition.\r\nIn the United States, the series was released as a four-disc set in both high-definition formats, the Blu-ray version on single-layer BD-25 discs and the HD DVD set on dual-layer HD DVD-30 discs. The first U.S. high-definition releases omitted the extra disc of bonus features from the standard-definition boxed set, though these extras were included with new material in a special-edition Blu-ray released in 2011.\r\nBooks\r\nFour official tie-in volumes were published by BBC Books in 2006 and 2007:\r\nPlanet Earth: As You've Never Seen It Before, written by Alastair Fothergill with a foreword by David Attenborough, was published in hardback on 5 October 2006 (ISBN 978-0563522126).\r\nThe paperback title Planet Earth: The Future was also published on 5 October 2006 (ISBN 978-0563539056). It was edited by Fergus Beeley and Rosamund Kidman Cox with a foreword by Jonathon Porritt.\r\nA second paperback volume revealed some of the tales from the field during filming expeditions. Planet Earth: The Making of an Epic Series was written by David Nicholson-Lord and published on 9 March 2006 (ISBN 978-0563493587).\r\nA collection of still images from the series was published in a hardcover volume as Planet Earth: The Photographs on 7 October 2007 (ISBN 978-1846073465).\r\nSoundtrack album\r\nOn 20 November 2006, a two-disc soundtrack CD was released with a compilation of the incidental music specially commissioned for Planet Earth. The award-winning score was composed by George Fenton and performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra and has been performed during \"Planet Earth Live\" events in the United States and the United Kingdom.",
      "html": "<p>Planet Earth is a 2006 British television series produced by the BBC Natural History Unit. Five years in the making, it was the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC and also the first to be filmed in high definition. The series received multiple awards, including four Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and an award from the Royal Television Society.</p><p>Planet Earth premiered on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and by June 2007 had been shown in 130 countries. The original version was narrated by David Attenborough, whilst some international versions used alternative narrators.</p><p>The series has eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview of a different biome or habitat on Earth. At the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series.</p><p>Ten years later, the BBC announced a six-part sequel had been commissioned, titled Planet Earth II, the first television series produced by the BBC in ultra-high-definition (4K). David Attenborough returned as narrator and presenter. A second sequel, Planet Earth III is currently announced and planned to air in 2023.</p><br/><h3>Background</h3><p>In 2001 the BBC broadcast The Blue Planet, a series on the natural history of the world's oceans. It received critical acclaim, high viewing figures, audience appreciation ratings, and many awards. It also became a hugely profitable global brand, eventually being sold to 150 countries worldwide. Feedback showed that audiences particularly liked the epic scale, the scenes of new and unusual species and the cinematic quality of the series. Programme commissioners were keen for a follow-up, so Alastair Fothergill decided that the Natural History Unit should repeat the formula with a series looking at the whole planet. The idea for Planet Earth was born, and the series was commissioned by Lorraine Heggessey, then Controller of BBC One, in January 2002.</p><p>A feature film version of Planet Earth was commissioned alongside the television series, repeating the successful model established with The Blue Planet and its companion film, Deep Blue. Earth was released around the world from 2007 to 2009. There was also another accompanying television series, Planet Earth: The Future, which looked at the environmental problems facing some of the species and habitats featured in the main series in more detail.</p><br/><h3>Broadcast</h3><p>Planet Earth premiered on BBC One on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom. On the same day or in the subsequent weeks or months, the series also began airing in several other countries.</p><p>International broadcasters carrying Planet Earth include Australia on ABC and GEM, Canada on CBC and CTV, New Zealand on Prime, the Philippines on GMA Network and GMA News TV, the U.S. on Discovery Channel, Velocity, Science, Animal Planet, Destination America and BBC America.</p><h4>British television</h4><p>The episodes are each an hour in length, comprising the main programme and a 10-minute featurette called Planet Earth Diaries, which details the filming of a particular event. In the UK, Planet Earth was split into two parts, broadcast in spring and autumn 2006. The first five episodes premiered on BBC One at 9:00 pm on Sundays, beginning on 5 March 2006. The programmes were repeated the following Saturday in an early evening slot on BBC Two. Along with its 2005 dramatisation of Bleak House, the BBC selected Planet Earth for its trial of high-definition broadcasts. The opening episode was its first-ever scheduled programme in the format, shown 27 May 2006 on the BBC HD channel.</p><p>The first episode in the autumn series, Great Plains, received its first public showing at the Edinburgh International Television Festival on 26 August 2006. It was shown on a giant screen in Conference Square. The remaining episodes were broadcast from 5 November 2006 in the same primetime BBC One slot, following a further repeat run of the spring programmes on BBC Four. The autumn episodes were broadcast simultaneously on BBC HD and were repeated on BBC Four the following week.</p><p>Besides being BBC One's featured One to Watch programme of the day, Planet Earth was heavily trailed on the BBC's television and radio channels both before and during its run. The music that was featured in the BBC trailers for the series is the track \"Hoppípolla\" from the album Takk... by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós. Following the advertisements, interest was so widespread that the single was re-released. In the United States, the series was promoted using \"The Time Has Come\" from trailer music company Epic Score, composed by Gabriel Shadid and Tobias Marberger. The Australian trailers initially used Jupiter: The Bringer of Jollity from Gustav Holst's orchestral suite The Planets, but later reverted to \"Hoppípolla\".</p><h4>International</h4><p>The BBC pre-sold the series to several overseas broadcasters, including the Discovery Channel for the United States, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, China Central Television, WDR for Germany, Discovery Channel for India, Prime Television for New Zealand, and C1R for Russian broadcasts. The series was eventually sold to 130 countries.</p><p>On 25 March 2007, the series began its run on American television on the Discovery network, premiering on the Discovery Channel and Discovery HD Theater. There were a number of revisions to the original British programme. Actress and conservationist Sigourney Weaver was brought in to replace David Attenborough as narrator, as it was thought her familiarity to American audiences would attract more viewers. The Discovery programmes also used a slightly different script to the British original. The series was broadcast on Sundays in one 3-hour block followed by four 2-hour blocks. The Planet Earth Diaries segments were not shown immediately after each episode, but collectively in Planet Earth: The Filmmakers' Story, a two-hour special which was broadcast after the series had finished its initial network run. Edited versions were later broadcast on The Science Channel, Animal Planet, and Planet Green.</p><p>In Canada, the series did not air on the Canadian Discovery Channel, as it is owned by CTV and the Canadian rights were exclusively sold to the CBC.</p><br/><h3>Episodes</h3><blockquote>\"A hundred years ago, there were one and a half billion people on Earth.

Meanwhile, as spring arrives in the <span>Arctic</span>, <span>polar bear</span> cubs take their first steps into a world of rapidly thawing ice. In northern Canada, 3 million <span class=\"mw-redirect\">caribou</span> complete an overland migration of 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi), longer than that of any animal, and are hunted by wolves during their journey. The forests of eastern Russia are home to the <span>Amur leopard</span>; with a population of just 40 individuals in the wild, it is now the world's rarest cat.

Its waters drop unbroken for nearly 1,000  meters (3,000  feet) and are blown away as a mist before they reach the bottom.

Also featured are <span class=\"mw-redirect\">smooth coated otters</span> repelling <span>mugger crocodiles</span> and the latter's <span>Nile cousin</span> ambushing <span>wildebeest</span> as they cross the <span>Mara River</span>. East African rift valley holds three of the world's largest lakes: <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Tanganyika</span>, and <span>Victoria</span>. Lake Malawi contains 850 different <span>Cichlids</span> that originated from their same ancestors that were isolated thousands of years ago, along with nocturnal predatory dolphin fish. Deep in the dead zone of Malawi, swarms of fly midges emerge from larvae during the rainy season and began their process of mating. In lake Baikal of Eastern Siberia, <span>Baikal seal</span> and freshwater sponges thrive here despite the ice sheet that covers the lake. The <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Amazon river</span>, the biggest river in the world, flows from the Andes toward the Atlantic oceans carrying a billion tonnes of sediments. Its tributary, <span>Rio Negro</span>, contains a mixture of sediments and saltwater where it supports <span>botos</span> feeding habit. Between the border of Brazil and Argentina lies <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Iguassu Falls</span>, which is the widest waterfall ever known. In <span>Pantanal</span> wetlands, 300 species of fish breed here, including the <span>Red-bellied piranhas</span> and <span>Dorados</span>.

The sounds of the jungle throughout the day are explored, from the early morning calls of <span>siamangs</span> and <span>orangutans</span> to the nocturnal cacophony of courting <span>tree frogs</span>. The importance of <span>fungi</span> to the <span>Amazon rainforest</span> is illustrated by a sequence of them fruiting, including a <span>parasite</span> that infested insects, called <span>cordyceps</span>. In <span>Borneo</span>, nocturnal <span>colugo</span> is one of the rare species ever discovered and travels two miles while foraging for young leaves.The mutual benefits of the relationship between carnivorous <span>pitcher plants</span> and red <span class=\"mw-redirect\">crab spiders</span> is also discussed. In the <span>Congo</span>, roaming <span>forest elephants</span> are shown reaching a clearing to feed on essential <span>clay</span> minerals within the mud. Finally, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">chimpanzees</span> are one of the few jungle animals able to traverse both the forest floor and the canopy in search of food. In <span>Uganda</span>, members of a 150-strong community of the primates mount a raid into neighbouring territory in order to gain control of it.</p><i>Planet Earth Diaries</i> looks at filming displaying birds of paradise, focusing mainly on the filming of the <span>six-plumed bird of paradise</span>. \"Jungles\" served as a major inspiration in developing the video game <i><span>The Last of Us</span></i>, which features a mutated strain of the cordyceps fungus infecting humans and almost destroying mankind.</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep9\" style=\"text-align:center\">9</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Shallow Seas\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">26 November 2006</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">8 April 2007</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">7.32</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #00B050\"><p>This programme is devoted to the shallow seas that fringe the world's <span>continents</span>. Although they constitute 8% of the oceans, they contain most marine life. As <span class=\"mw-redirect\">humpback whales</span> return to breeding grounds in the tropics, a mother and its calf are followed. While the latter takes in up to 500 litres of milk a day, its parent will starve until it travels back to the poles to feed—and it must do this while it still has sufficient energy left for the journey. The coral reefs of <span>Indonesia</span> are home to the biggest variety of ocean dwellers, including the <span>Pygmy seahorses</span>, and <span>file clam</span>. Other ocean dwellers such as banded sea <span>kraits</span>, which ally themselves with <span>goatfish</span> and <span>trevally</span> in order to hunt. Beyond the coral stretches the world of shifting sands, ocean dwellers, such as <span class=\"mw-disambig\">Gurnard</span>, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Jawfish</span>, <span>Green sea turtle</span>, and <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Wonderpus octopus</span>, are forced to cope with their environment through crucial camouflage and foraging where they have nowhere else hide. In <span>Shark Bay</span> of <span>Western Australia</span>, <span>Dugongs</span> forage across the largest aquatic grassland  eating tons of seagrasses a day while <span>bottlenose dolphins</span> perform their \"hydroplane\" in the shallowest waters to catch a meal. Meanwhile in the desert shores of <span>Bahrain</span>, 100,000 <span>Socotra cormorants</span> rely on <span>shamals</span> that blow sand grains into the nearby <span>Persian Gulf</span>, transforming it into a rich fishing ground. The appearance of <span>algae</span> in the spring starts a food chain that leads to an abundant harvest of <span>Salps</span>, <span>Krills</span>, and <span>comb jellies</span>. As shoals of migratory fish feasts on the krills, <span>sea lions</span> and <span>dusky dolphins</span> are among those taking advantage of it. Within the coastline of <span>California</span>, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Giant kelps</span> fertilizes algaes making them the tallest kelps ever recorded which causes group of <span>Sea urchins</span> to infest them creating urchin barrens. Within the urchin barrens, group of <span>starfishes</span>, <span>sand dollars</span>, and <span>brittle stars</span> scavenge across the barrens while facing against their fierce predator, <span>Sunflower sea star</span>. In <span>Southern Africa</span>, as <span>chokka squid</span> are preyed on by <span>short-tail stingray</span> and <span>sand tiger shark</span>, the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Cape fur seals</span> that share the waters are hunted by the world's largest predatory fish—the <span>great white shark</span>.

Few creatures can survive the Arctic climate year round, but the <span>moose</span>, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">capercaillie</span>, and <span>wolverine</span> are exceptions. 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) to the south, on the <span>Pacific</span> coast of North America, conifers have reached their full potential. These include some of the world's <span>tallest trees</span>: the <span>redwoods</span>.

During spring in a European broad-leafed forest, a <span>mandarin duck</span> leads its day-old family to leap from its tree trunk nest to the leaf litter below. The <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Bialowieza Forest</span> typifies the habitat that characterised Europe around 6,000 years ago: only a fragment remains in <span>Poland</span> and <span>Belarus</span>.

It begins with a <span>whale shark</span> used as a shield by a shoal of <span>bait fish</span> to protect themselves from <span>yellowfin tuna</span>. Also shown is an <span>oceanic whitetip shark</span> trailing rainbow runners. Meanwhile, a 500-strong school of <span>dolphins</span> head for the <span>Azores</span>, where they work together to feast on <span>scad mackerel</span> along with a flock of <span>shearwaters</span>. Down in the ocean's furthest reaches, some creatures defy classification.

The volcanic mountain chain at the bottom of the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> also sustains life through the bacteria that surround its sulphide vents which allows shrimps to feed. Within the Western Pacific bordering <span>Japan</span> lies the Dragon chimneys erupted from thermal vents where different forms of baterias thrives. In <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Atlantic</span>, <span>Squat lobsters</span> settle near the hydrothermal vents grazing on bacterias. From the depths of Galapagos Island at the site of the Nine North, the chimneys provides energy for <span>tube worms</span> to grow and support settlement, but after nine months the chimneys turns cold causing the tube worms to wither and extinguished. There are thought to be around 30,000 <span class=\"mw-redirect\">undersea volcanoes</span>, some of them taller than <span>Mount Everest</span>. Their sheer cliffs provide anchorage for several corals and sponges. Nearer the surface, the currents that surround these <span>seamounts</span> force nutrients up from below and thus marine life around them is abundant, which allows the <span>Nautilus</span> to forage freely before retreat to the depth. Thirty miles away, the shoal of squids jets upwards to the stream to hunt small fish and planktons while avoiding the <span>pacific spotted dolphins</span> as they use sonar to confuse their prey. The giant <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Mola Mola</span> settle at reef for cleaning via <span class=\"mw-redirect\">butterfly fish</span> feeding parasites and cool temperature. <span>Ascension Island</span> is a nesting ground for <span>frigatebirds</span> and <span class=\"mw-redirect\">green turtles</span>. Off the <span>Mexican</span> coast, a large group of <span>sailfish</span> feed on another shoal of bait fish, changing colour to signal their intentions to each other, allowing them to coordinate their attack. The last sequence depicts the largest animal on Earth—the <span>blue whale</span>, of which 300,000 once roamed the world's oceans with 3000 individuals roam the planet which they are now fewer than 3% remain.</p><i>Planet Earth Diaries</i> shows the search in the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Bahamas</span> for oceanic whitetip sharks.</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote>\"Our planet is still full of wonders. As we explore them, so we gain not only understanding, but power. It's not just the future of the whale that today lies in our hands: it's the survival of the natural world in all parts of the living planet. We can now destroy or we can cherish. The choice is ours.\"— David Attenborough, in closing</blockquote><br/><h3>Planet Earth: The Future</h3><p>The latter episodes were supplemented by Planet Earth: The Future, a series of three 60-minute films that highlight the conservation issues surrounding some of the featured species and environments. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was Fergus Beeley. The series began transmission on BBC Four after the ninth episode, \"Shallow Seas\".</p><br/><h3>Feature film</h3><p>Alongside the commissioning of the television series, BBC Worldwide and GreenLight Media secured financing for a US$15 million film version of Planet Earth. This followed the earlier success of Deep Blue, the BBC's 2003 theatrical nature documentary which used re-edited footage from The Blue Planet. The film was co-directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield and produced by Alix Tidmarsh and Sophokles Tasioulis. Only 30% of the footage shown in Earth is new, with the remainder being reworked from the television series to suit the narrative of the film. David Attenborough was replaced as narrator by high-profile actors: Patrick Stewart for the UK market and James Earl Jones for the United States.</p><p>Earth had its worldwide premiere in September 2007 at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in San Sebastián, Spain, in Basque Country. Lionsgate released the film in several international markets over the following year. In the United States, it became the first film to be released by Disneynature, the Walt Disney Company's new nature documentary arm. When released on Earth Day 2009 it set the record for the highest opening weekend gross for a nature documentary, and went on to become the third highest grossing documentary of all time. It has grossed more than $108 million worldwide; in the nature documentary genre, only March of the Penguins has achieved greater box-office success.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical reception</h4><p>Planet Earth received widespread critical acclaim. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 95% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The critical consensus reads \"Planet Earth weaves innovative camera techniques and patient observation to deliver viewers an astounding glimpse of the world's perils and wonders, capturing jaw-dropping scenery and animals on both an epic and intimate scale.\" Time magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 New TV Series of 2007, ranking it at No. 4. In 2019, Planet Earth and its sequel were ranked 72nd on The Guardian's list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>Planet Earth: From Pole to Pole won the Science and Natural History award at the Royal Television Society Programme Awards in 2007. The RTS also awarded it a Judge's Award and a Photography Award at its Craft and Design Awards. The series picked up two awards from the Broadcasting Press Guild for Best Documentary Series and Innovation in Broadcasting, and won Best Documentary Series at the 2007 Broadcast Awards. At the 2007 BAFTA Television Awards, Planet Earth was nominated in the Specialist Factual and Pioneer Audience Award categories, but lost out to Nuremberg: Goering's Last Stand and Life on Mars respectively. It received three nominations at the BAFTA Television Craft Awards later the same year. George Fenton's original score won him Soundtrack Composer of the Year at the 2007 Classical BRIT Awards. Planet Earth was also nominated for the NTA for Most popular Factual program but lost to Top Gear (Supernanny and Bad Lad's Army: Officer Class were also nominated).</p><p>Planet Earth was recognised by the American television industry, collecting the award for Nonfiction Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2007 and winning a further three prizes in technical categories at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. It also collected two awards from the Television Critics Association in Los Angeles in July 2007 and a Peabody Award in April 2008.</p><p>The series was also fêted at wildlife film festivals around the globe, collected multiple prizes at the Wildscreen Festival 2006, the International Wildlife Film Festival 2007 and the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival 2007.</p><h4>Awards and nominations</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th>Year</th><th>Award</th><th>Category</th><th>Nominee</th><th>Result</th><th class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"References\">Ref.</abbr></th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">2006</td><td rowspan=\"3\"><span>Royal Television Society Craft &amp;

The first episode, \"From Pole to Pole\", was watched by more people than any natural history programme since Attenborough and Fothergill's previous series, The Blue Planet, in 2001. The first five episodes drew an average audience of 11.4 million viewers, including the early evening repeats, outperforming even The Blue Planet. When the series returned to British screens after a six-month break, it remained popular but viewing figures did not reach the same levels. The final six episodes attracted an average audience of 6.8 million viewers, appreciably lower than the spring episodes, but still higher than BBC One's average for the timeslot. The BBC's 2007 Annual Report revealed that the series \"received the highest audience appreciation score of any British programme on TV this year\".</p><p>In the United States, Planet Earth drew equally impressive ratings when it premiered on Discovery and Discovery HD Theater on 25 March 2007. The first three episodes (screened back to back) averaged 5.72 million viewers with a peak of 6.07 million viewers, giving the network its third highest audience ever. It was also the most watched Discovery programme since The Flight That Fought Back in 2005.</p><br/><h3>Sequel</h3><p>In February 2016, the BBC announced a six-part sequel had been commissioned, titled Planet Earth II, for release in late 2016, with Sir David Attenborough returning as narrator and presenter. As with the 2006 series, the trailer features the track 'Hoppipolla' by Icelandic group Sigur Ros.</p><br/><h3>Merchandise</h3><p>The popularity of the television series around the world translated into strong sales of associated Planet Earth merchandise. In the United States, it became the fastest and bestselling documentary DVD in Discovery Channel's history, and the high-definition (HD) discs generated US$3.2 million in sales in just two months. By the end of 2007, U.S. sales had topped 3 million units, making it the highest-grossing HD title and one of the top ten DVD titles of the year.</p><p>In addition, the brand was licensed to other companies to produce children's books, calendars, a board game, jigsaws, stationery, cards, and more.</p><h4>DVD</h4><p>A five-disc DVD box set of the complete series (BBCDVD1883) was released in the UK for Regions 2 and 4 (PAL) on 27 November 2006 by 2 entertain. It is presented in 5.1-channel Dolby Digital surround sound and 16:9 widescreen video. The bonus features include Planet Earth Diaries (presented immediately after each episode as for the original TV broadcast) and Planet Earth: The Future. In the United States, two versions of the same five-disc set were released as a Region 1 (NTSC) DVD on 24 April 2007. The BBC Warner release retained David Attenborough's narration from the original British television broadcasts, but the Discovery Channel edition used the alternative Sigourney Weaver voice-over. Even in the United States the Attenborough version was much the better for sales.</p><h4>HD DVD and Blu-ray</h4><p>Except for a small amount of extremely hard-to-obtain footage, Planet Earth was filmed entirely in high-definition, and consequently became one of the first television series to take advantage of the new HD disc formats.</p><p>The series was released in both Blu-ray and HD DVD formats as a five-disc Region B box set on 12 November 2007. On the fifth disc, the bonus features from the standard-definition DVD set were replaced by two episodes from the BBC's Natural World series, \"Desert Lions\" and \"Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth\", both also presented in high-definition.</p><p>In the United States, the series was released as a four-disc set in both high-definition formats, the Blu-ray version on single-layer BD-25 discs and the HD DVD set on dual-layer HD DVD-30 discs. The first U.S. high-definition releases omitted the extra disc of bonus features from the standard-definition boxed set, though these extras were included with new material in a special-edition Blu-ray released in 2011.</p><h4>Books</h4><p>Four official tie-in volumes were published by BBC Books in 2006 and 2007:</p><ul><li>Planet Earth: As You've Never Seen It Before, written by Alastair Fothergill with a foreword by David Attenborough, was published in hardback on 5 October 2006 (ISBN 978-0563522126).</li><li>The paperback title Planet Earth: The Future was also published on 5 October 2006 (ISBN 978-0563539056). It was edited by Fergus Beeley and Rosamund Kidman Cox with a foreword by Jonathon Porritt.</li><li>A second paperback volume revealed some of the tales from the field during filming expeditions. Planet Earth: The Making of an Epic Series was written by David Nicholson-Lord and published on 9 March 2006 (ISBN 978-0563493587).</li><li>A collection of still images from the series was published in a hardcover volume as Planet Earth: The Photographs on 7 October 2007 (ISBN 978-1846073465).</li></ul><h4>Soundtrack album</h4><p>On 20 November 2006, a two-disc soundtrack CD was released with a compilation of the incidental music specially commissioned for Planet Earth. The award-winning score was composed by George Fenton and performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra and has been performed during \"Planet Earth Live\" events in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p><br/>"
