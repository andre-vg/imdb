Get Back received critical acclaim for its coverage of the group's creative process, although detractors criticised the relatively long runtime. Commentators described it as challenging longtime beliefs that the making of the Let It Be album was marked entirely by tensions between the Beatles, instead showing a more upbeat side to its production.\r\nProduction\r\nWhile visiting Apple Corps to discuss working on a potential Beatles exhibition featuring augmented or virtual reality, Peter Jackson asked Apple about the archival footage for the 1970 documentary of the album, which he was allowed access to for a potential new documentary. Jackson was hesitant to sign onto the project because of his fears about the long-reported acrimony surrounding the Beatles breakup. Upon viewing the footage, he later stated, he \"was relieved to discover the reality is very different to the myth ... Sure, there's moments of drama – but none of the discord this project has long been associated with.\" Sixty hours of film footage, shot in January 1969, and over 150 hours of audio stemming from the original Let It Be film were made available to Jackson's team.\r\nProduction of The Beatles: Get Back employed film restoration techniques developed for Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old. Jackson spent close to four years editing the series. It was created with cooperation from Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and the widows of John Lennon (Yoko Ono) and George Harrison (Olivia Harrison), as well as music supervisor Giles Martin (son of George Martin and a regular producer of Beatles projects since 2006). In a news release, McCartney said: \"I am really happy that Peter has delved into our archives to make a film that shows the truth about the Beatles recording together\", while Starr echoed: \"There was hours and hours of us just laughing and playing music, not at all like the Let It Be film that came out. There was a lot of joy and I think Peter will show that.\"\r\nDisney was persuaded by the filmmakers to allow for the inclusion of profanity, with viewer discretion warnings at the start of each episode. According to Jackson: \"The Beatles are Scouse boys and they freely swear but not in an aggressive or sexual way. We got Disney to agree to have swearing, which I think is the first time for a Disney channel.\" Episodes also contain viewer discretion warnings for tobacco use. As a result, the theatrical release of The Beatles: Get Back – The Rooftop Concert received a PG-13 rating by the MPA for \"brief strong language, and smoking\".\r\nEpisodes\r\nContent\r\nThe final cut covers 21 days in the studio with the Beatles as they rehearse for a forthcoming album, concert and film project, and climaxes with the full 42-minute rooftop concert. Jackson described the series as \"a documentary about a documentary\", as well as a \"tougher\" one than Let It Be, since it includes controversial events such as Harrison's brief resignation from the band, which the original film had not covered. With the exception of specific shots where no alternative exists, most of the material that had been featured in Let It Be was not reused in Get Back, and the series primarily used footage captured from alternative camera angles in the case of sequences shared between the two works. According to Jackson, this choice was made out of a desire to \"not step on Let It Be's toes so that it is still a film that has a reason to exist, and our will be a supplement to it\".\r\nBen Sisario of The New York Times emphasises opening scenes of the series from January 1969, with McCartney creating the song \"Get Back\" \"out of nothing\" while awaiting Lennon who was running late. In his review, Sisario further posits that: Lennon's only aim in the Get Back project was \"communication with an audience\", McCartney asked the band to \"show enthusiasm for the project or abandon it\", Harrison openly contemplated \"a divorce\" (of the band), while the whole band were uncomfortable about Ono's presence at the sessions. However, the last statement is opposed by Andy Welch of The Guardian in his review of the documentary, who remarks: \"Yoko didn’t break up the Beatles. Blaming it on her was always an absurd, lazy accusation\". In other candid scenes, Starr offers Ono a piece of gum, Linda McCartney and Ono whisper as the band plays \"Let It Be\", Harrison impresses the band with a Bob Dylan cover, McCartney covers \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" with Lennon's approval, and McCartney defends Ono while grieving for the band's end.\r\nAnother key scene involves an off-camera lunch between Lennon and McCartney. The filmmakers put a microphone in the plant on the table unbeknownst to anyone, where it picked up the conversation. During the lunch, Lennon tells McCartney that he has become the leader of the group, which McCartney denies (\"You're still the boss, I'm just the secondary boss\").

The 30 January presentation was accompanied by a live-streamed Q&A with Jackson.

A one-minute clip of the film was released on YouTube on 12 November, containing a scene with the Beatles working on the song \"I've Got a Feeling\".\r\nThe release was preceded by the publication of a book of the same name – the first official book credited to the band since The Beatles Anthology (2000) – featuring an introduction by Hanif Kureishi. The book was initially scheduled for 31 August 2021 to coincide with the initial August release of the documentary, but was ultimately released on 12 October, ahead of the documentary. The documentary was also preceded by the release of a remixed, deluxe edition box set of the Let It Be album on 15 October by Apple Records.\r\nReception\r\nCritical reception\r\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93% based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"It may be too much of a good thing for some viewers, but The Beatles: Get Back offers a thrillingly immersive look at the band's creative process.\" Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 28 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nSheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter called the documentary an \"immersive, in-the-moment chronicle of a generation-defining band in the act of creating, offering an up-close look at the quartet's alchemy\" and concluded that it \"offers ample evidence that necessity is in the eye of the beholder\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone complimented the miniseries' intimacy, highlighting its poignant and \"quiet moments\" as \"the heart of the film\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the miniseries a score of four out of four stars, deeming it \"one of the most entertaining, compelling and important chapters in filmed music history\" and praising the quality of the footage of the rooftop performance. In a five-star review for The Independent, Ed Cumming wrote that the acrimony besetting the Beatles had \"taken on a mythic quality\" since Lindsay-Hogg's 1970 film, but through Jackson's expanded coverage, \"Any future assessment of the band and its members will have to measure up against the people we see here.\"\r\nOwen Gleiberman, writing for Variety, said that while the story \"meanders\" and gets \"bloated\" in Part Three, it is an \"addictive\" portrait of a \"transcendent\" band that goes above \"both the hype and fan anxiety\". The Guardian's Alexis Petridis called the series \"aimless\", with repetition that was a \"threat to the viewer's sanity\", and said that while it had \"fantastic moments\", they were too few and far between. Writing in The Times, Beatles biographer Philip Norman was highly critical of the editing of the footage and general tone of Jackson's work, commenting that several \"inconvenient facts\", including Lennon's heroin addiction and the \"baiting\" of Ono, were ignored.\r\nAccolades\r\nSoundtrack\r\nThis is a list of all the songs heard in The Beatles: Get Back.

      "html": "<p>The Beatles: Get Back is a 2021 documentary series directed and produced by Peter Jackson. It covers the making of the Beatles' 1970 album Let It Be (which had the working title of Get Back) and draws largely from unused footage and audio material originally captured for the 1970 documentary of the album by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. The docuseries has a total runtime of nearly eight hours, consisting of three episodes, each of duration between two and three hours covering about one week, together covering 21 days of studio time.</p><p>Also co-produced by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison, the series is presented by Walt Disney Studios in association with Apple Corps and WingNut Films. It premiered with three consecutive daily releases on Disney+ beginning on 25 November 2021. A portion of it, titled The Beatles: Get Back – The Rooftop Concert, was given a theatrical release in IMAX theatres across numerous US cities on 30 January 2022. It was then released internationally between 11 and 13 February 2022. The Beatles: Get Back was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 12 July 2022.</p><p>Jackson characterised the miniseries as \"a documentary about a documentary\". Get Back received critical acclaim for its coverage of the group's creative process, although detractors criticised the relatively long runtime. Commentators described it as challenging longtime beliefs that the making of the Let It Be album was marked entirely by tensions between the Beatles, instead showing a more upbeat side to its production.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>While visiting Apple Corps to discuss working on a potential Beatles exhibition featuring augmented or virtual reality, Peter Jackson asked Apple about the archival footage for the 1970 documentary of the album, which he was allowed access to for a potential new documentary. Jackson was hesitant to sign onto the project because of his fears about the long-reported acrimony surrounding the Beatles breakup. Upon viewing the footage, he later stated, he \"was relieved to discover the reality is very different to the myth ... Sure, there's moments of drama – but none of the discord this project has long been associated with.\" Sixty hours of film footage, shot in January 1969, and over 150 hours of audio stemming from the original Let It Be film were made available to Jackson's team.</p><p>Production of The Beatles: Get Back employed film restoration techniques developed for Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old. Jackson spent close to four years editing the series. It was created with cooperation from Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and the widows of John Lennon (Yoko Ono) and George Harrison (Olivia Harrison), as well as music supervisor Giles Martin (son of George Martin and a regular producer of Beatles projects since 2006). In a news release, McCartney said: \"I am really happy that Peter has delved into our archives to make a film that shows the truth about the Beatles recording together\", while Starr echoed: \"There was hours and hours of us just laughing and playing music, not at all like the Let It Be film that came out. There was a lot of joy and I think Peter will show that.\"</p><p>Disney was persuaded by the filmmakers to allow for the inclusion of profanity, with viewer discretion warnings at the start of each episode. According to Jackson: \"The Beatles are Scouse boys and they freely swear but not in an aggressive or sexual way. We got Disney to agree to have swearing, which I think is the first time for a Disney channel.\" Episodes also contain viewer discretion warnings for tobacco use. As a result, the theatrical release of The Beatles: Get Back – The Rooftop Concert received a PG-13 rating by the MPA for \"brief strong language, and smoking\".</p><br/><h3>Episodes</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr style=\"color:white;text-align:center\"><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#000000;width:5%\"><abbr title=\"Number\">No.</abbr></th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#000000\">Title</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#000000\">Directed by <span style=\"background-color:white;padding:1px;display:inline-block;line-height:50%\"></span></th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#000000\">Original release date <span style=\"background-color:white;padding:1px;display:inline-block;line-height:50%\"></span></th></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep1\" style=\"text-align:center\">1</th><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Part 1: Days 1–7\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><span>Peter Jackson</span></td><td style=\"text-align:center\">25 November 2021</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #000000\">The Beatles begin rehearsing at <span>Twickenham Studios</span> for what is at first meant to be a television special about the recording of their next album leading up to a live show at a location to be determined.

Music publisher <span>Dick James</span> appears and runs through the latest catalogue of songs he has acquired for <span>Northern Songs</span>. Director <span>Michael Lindsay-Hogg</span> tries to persuade the Beatles to end the project with an impressive live show.

Jackson described the series as \"a documentary about a documentary\", as well as a \"tougher\" one than Let It Be, since it includes controversial events such as Harrison's brief resignation from the band, which the original film had not covered. With the exception of specific shots where no alternative exists, most of the material that had been featured in Let It Be was not reused in Get Back, and the series primarily used footage captured from alternative camera angles in the case of sequences shared between the two works. According to Jackson, this choice was made out of a desire to \"not step on Let It Be's toes so that it is still a film that has a reason to exist, and our will be a supplement to it\".</p><p>Ben Sisario of The New York Times emphasises opening scenes of the series from January 1969, with McCartney creating the song \"Get Back\" \"out of nothing\" while awaiting Lennon who was running late. In his review, Sisario further posits that: Lennon's only aim in the Get Back project was \"communication with an audience\", McCartney asked the band to \"show enthusiasm for the project or abandon it\", Harrison openly contemplated \"a divorce\" (of the band), while the whole band were uncomfortable about Ono's presence at the sessions. However, the last statement is opposed by Andy Welch of The Guardian in his review of the documentary, who remarks: \"Yoko didn’t break up the Beatles. Blaming it on her was always an absurd, lazy accusation\". In other candid scenes, Starr offers Ono a piece of gum, Linda McCartney and Ono whisper as the band plays \"Let It Be\", Harrison impresses the band with a Bob Dylan cover, McCartney covers \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" with Lennon's approval, and McCartney defends Ono while grieving for the band's end.</p><p>Another key scene involves an off-camera lunch between Lennon and McCartney. The filmmakers put a microphone in the plant on the table unbeknownst to anyone, where it picked up the conversation. During the lunch, Lennon tells McCartney that he has become the leader of the group, which McCartney denies (\"You're still the boss, I'm just the secondary boss\"). They also discuss their treatment of Harrison, reminisce about the past and discuss the future of the group.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Streaming and home media</h4><p>The project was announced on 30 January 2019, the fiftieth anniversary of the Beatles' rooftop concert.
