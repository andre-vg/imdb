      "question": "What would the operating costs of a theme park with this level of sophistication be?",
      "answer": "It's impossible to say. Given that it's a fictional island in a fictional future.In season 2 it's revealed that Delos owns the island. And that it is located somewhere within China's jurisdiction. In the early days of the park it's mentioned that the park was hemorrhaging money. But once Delos took over, they were able to figure out a cost-effective way of operating the park. It's mentioned that the newest version of hosts are far more streamlined and cheaper to build and repair."

The current generation of hosts are made of synthetic blood and bone. More cyborgs than robots. It is likely when a host gets upgraded, they simply upload their personalities in to the new model. It's stated that these new hosts are cheaper to repair and manufacture compared to the older, robotic types."

      "question": "How do the guns work?",
      "answer": "The guns are computer controlled by the technicians in the operations center. They are able to read the difference between hosts and guests. When fired at a host, the rounds convert to live ammo. When fired at a guest, the are akin to a paintball. They still hurt but leave no more than a welt."
