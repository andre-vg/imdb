      "content": "Okay, so the bottom line is \"harshad mehta\" was involved in most of the wrong doing but was he the only guy responsible ? No, Never. In a scam like huge as 1992 shown in this series, it was never one person befooling the entire nation. This show has 2 names written all over it, pratik gandhi (harshad mehta) and the creator himself Hansal mehta. What a crazy show he has pulled off, no big actors with huge following but bunch of actors who have shown their par excellence in this 9 episode long series. this is the best work of hansal mehta that he has pulled of in his career. From the scene 1 to the last pratik gandhi has stole the show. what a great addition to the film industry. The strongest point in this very complicated series filled with so many jargons is the fact is it's screenplay. to the point, no nonsense, no strong language without any use, no vulgarity and just a focus on story-line. a Strong screenplay and good direction is always the key to the film/ series and SCAM 1992 is here to proof. don't think just watch it, you love it and want to watch it in just one go. too good to be made for an Indian audience which focuses only on one thing a good meme templates, which this series is definitely not.a must must watch"

This is completely a new experience to watch. I loved the role of Harshad Mehta, Ashwin Mehta and his friend from Stock Market the Seth. Hated Sucheta Dalal to a great extent. I would watch this series sometime again. It's once in a lifetime work. Hats off to the team!"

Though the thinking was wrong, the approach to him was bias and harsh as he was the only responsible person for everything, which isn't the case as visible from the story atleast. The cast has been simply outstanding, Pratik, Shreya, Rajat , and every other person was beyond fabulous. It's so great to see such a story but would have been even more successful if had been on a better stage like Netflix or prime which is in almost every other home. If you are someone who likes to see the real drama behind the story, who believes in true story, dare not to miss this."

Hats off to Hansal Mehta for this brilliant direction.The casting has been the highlight of this series with Pratik Gandhi as Harshad Mehta and Shreya Dhanwanthary as Suchita Dalal. The expressions and dialogue delivery is on point. The same goes for the rest of the cast and there is not a single one who is not worth 10/10 when it comes to acting.Absolutely worth the time."

      "content": "Let's get straight to the point. Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story is arguably the best Indian web show ever made. The sheer amount of research and detailing that went into the making of this series is commendable. This is one of the finest storytelling in recent times backed by a lifetime performance. Both Hansal Mehta the director and lead actor Prateek Gandhi hit it out of the park with this one. To execute a stock exchange drama and make it interesting is not an easy task but Hansal succeeds in doing this. For someone like me coming from a non financial background it did take some time to adjust to all the stock market terms and understand them. But slowly and gradually as I got sucked into this world there was no looking back. The show just kept on getting interesting and dramatic as it moved on. While the first half of the show is centred around Harshad's rise from rags to riches. The second half is about his downfall as the noose starts tightening around him. To his credit Hansal Mehta doesn't take any sides and tells the Harshad story without making a hero or an anti hero out of him. Here was a man who knew the system very well and used its loopholes and irregularities to his advantage. But his oversized ambition and greed eventually did him in. Speaking of performances Prateek Gandhi is Harshad Mehta. Period. This is the best performance of the year. He just owned this character. The rest of the supporting actors are very cleverly cast and they all are brilliant. The ones who stand out in particular are Shreya Dhanwanthary, Ananth Narayan Mahadevan, Nikhil Dwivedi, Rajat Kapoor and Shadaab Khan. Overall the show is a slow burner. It does tests your patience initially but keeps on getting better with every episode. You can't help but applaud the makers along with the whole team who executed this real life incident splendidly. This captivating drama with 10 whopping episodes comes across as an extremely well-written and directed piece of work. Take a bow Hansal Mehta! Streaming on Sonyliv now."

The series was very engaging and it made want to stream episode after episode till the end without boring me. Kudos to Hansel Mehta for that. He's a very talented director who has proved himself and I hope he would do more good project like this and not like his upcoming Amazon Prime movie which looks bad. I subscribed Sony Liv just to watch this and that's Rs 300 well spent. Hope they have more to offer like this."
