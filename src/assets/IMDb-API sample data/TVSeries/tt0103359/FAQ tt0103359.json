      "question": "Who created the character of Batman? Bob Kane is listed in old (pre-2015) media including the comic books as creating Batman on his own but new media (made after 2015) shows him as co-creating the character with someone called Bill Finger, so what's all that about?",
      "answer": "It's a long story so here goes....After the success of the comic book Superhero Superman, artist tried to come up with his own hero \"The Bat-Man\", the character Kane created wore a red suit with a domino mask, blonde hair and a pair of bat wings. Kane then asked for writer Bill Finger's assistance on the project. Finger rejected several of Kane's initial ideas about the character and suggested several changes in design and characterization. His changes included changing his hair colour, a black colour scheme for the costume, adding a cape and cowl, the idea that he shouldn't have any superpowers, his civilian identity of Bruce Wayne (which Finger named after Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland and general Anthony \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne), the origin story about his parents being shot in an alley and the idea that he should also be a detective.Kane marketed the \"Batman\" character to National Comics, and Batman's first story was published in \"Detective Comics\" #27 (May 1939). The script was written by an uncredited Finger, making him the first of many ghost writers to work on comics officially credited to Bob Kane. When Kane negotiated a contract about selling the rights to the \"Batman\" character, he claimed he was the sole creator and demanded a sole mandatory byline acknowledging him as such on all comics and adaptations. Out of fairness, Kane agreed to pay Finger his share with money out of his earnings. Unfortunately, the agreement was never put into writing, and Finger never saw a cent.Finger would go on to ghost write Batman stories up into the mid 1960's, either with Kane or for DC Comics directly. During his writing tenure, Finger was responsible for the unaccredited creation of many key players and pieces in the Batman universe.These included the Batmobile, the Batcave, Gotham City, and Batman's nickname \"The Dark Knight\". He also came up with several secondary Batman characters including, his sidekick Robin, his arch-nemesis The Joker, and his occasional love interest Catwoman, as well as Commissioner Gordon, The Riddler and The Scarecrow. Despite all of this, the only writing credit that Finger received for Batman in his lifetime were two episode of Batman (1966), The Clock King's Crazy Crimes (1966) and The Clock King Gets Crowned (1966) which he co-wrote with friend Charles Sinclair.Eventually, the truth did come out. Finger attended the first official New York Comic Con in 1965 and sat on a panel with other comic book creators where he revealed the role he played in Batman's creation. Finger's story gained exposure in a two-page article titled \"If the truth be known, or a Finger in every plot!,\" written and distributed by pop culturist Jerry Bails. Kane caught wind of Finger's appearance not long after and replied in the form of a printed letter to Batman fan magazine, \"Batmania,\" where he labeled his old friend a fraud. Finger, who by this time was deeply in debt, continued to write for various projects in and outside of comic books until his death in 1974, when he was found alone in his apartment by friend Charles Sinclair. Finger died penniless and his contributions to the character was never acknowledged in his lifetime.However, after the popularity of Tim Burton's Batman (1989), Kane acknowledged Finger as \"a contributing force\" in the character's creation, and wrote in his 1989 autobiography \"Batman and Me\" that \"Now that my long-time friend and collaborator is gone, I must admit that Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if I could go back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put your name on it now. You deserve it.'\"Many failed attempts were made over the years by Finger's family to get him recognition for his work, including a request from his second wife Lyn Simmons to have his name listed in the credits of Tim Burton's Batman (1989).Finger remained largely unknown, even to Batman fans, until writer Marc Tyler Nobleman began investigating the late author's life for a book being written about him called \"Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-Creator of Batman\". Nobleman went in search of Finger's family to help fill in the gaps and give him credit. While Finger's autopsy report claimed no relatives were present, Nobleman discovered that Finger had a son, Fred.Unfortunately, Fred, who was an outspoken proponent of his father, had died in 1992. Nobleman learned that Fred was also homosexual, leading him to believe that Fred had no children before his death. The trail was starting to go cold.However, after receiving new information from Finger's nephew, Nobleman discovered Fred indeed had a daughter, Athena Finger, who was born two years after Finger's death. Nobleman met with Athena and convinced her to meet with DC about getting recognition for her grandfather. DC in turn welcomed Athena with open arms, cut her a check and invited her to the premiere of The Dark Knight (2008) with all expenses paid. It wasn't until around 2012 that DC offered her more money. This time, however, she had to sign away her rights to her grandfather's claim. With encouragement from Nobleman, Athena rejected the money and took DC to court.It took years of litigation before a settlement was reached. A major turning point in the case was the unearthing of recorded interviews with Bob Kane during the writing of his autobiography. During one of the interviews, Tom Andrae, Kane's co-writer, asked Kane to what extent Finger contributed to Batman's creation. \"Bill was responsible for 50 to 75 percent,\" Kane bluntly responded.Finally, in September 2015, DC Entertainment issued a statement informing the public that Finger would be listed as co-creator on any piece of Batman media henceforth. Starting with the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and the second season of Gotham (2014), an updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as \"Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger\".Finger's story was later used as the subject of the Hulu original documentary, Batman & Bill (2017).

She was created by writers Paul Dini and Mitch Brian and animator Bruce Timm. Her first comic appearance was in the comic story \"The Return of Scarface (Part I of III): Mustache Pete is Dead!\" from Batman #475 (March 1992).As for changes from the Batman comics, these include a new origin for Mr. Freeze by writer Paul Dini. In this new origin (see Heart of Ice (1992)) Freeze was given the real name Victor Fries, also we are introduced his terminally ill wife, Nora Fries, whom Victor cryogenically freezes whilst he tries to find a cure for her condition. He uses his boss's, Ferris Boyle's, company Gothcorps's equipment to Freeze his wife and the company's money to find a cure for her illness. When Ferris found out he angrily confronted Fries and during a scuffle Fries falls into some chemicals which freeze him making him need below zero temperatures to survive. He then goes after Boyle in revenge but is stopped by Batman. This new backstory explains his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds. This more complex, tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including film, television series, Video games and the comic book series themselves, which previously had the character casually killed off by the Joker. Mr Freeze was resurrected in the comics not long after Heart of Ice (1992) first aired.Also the creators of this series came up with tragic origin stories for villains like Clayface (see Feat of Clay: Part I (1992) & Feat of Clay: Part II (1992)), Two-Face (see Two-Face: Part I (1992) & Two-Face: Part II (1992), The Mad Hatter (see Mad as a Hatter (1992)) and The Riddler (see If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?

      "question": "Where is Gotham City located?",
      "answer": "Gotham City is a fictional U.S. port city located on the north-eastern Atlantic coast. It was originally a stand-in for New York City, but has also resembled other crime-ridden urban centers such as Chicago and Detroit. Some sources, including Mayfair Games' authorized (but now out-of-print) Atlas of the DC Universe, have placed Gotham City in the state of New Jersey. Batman: The Animated Series shows Gotham City in New York State on the western tip of Long Island.Christopher Nolan's (director for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) Gotham City is located in the middle of the estuary of the Liberty River, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The river separates most of Gotham from the mainland. The River Merchant divides Uptown from Midtown, while Midtown is separated from Downtown by the Gotham River. The Narrows is a small island in the Gotham River. A creek divides the district of South Hinkley from the rest of Gotham City. Gotham International Airport is in Pettsburg, to the north of the Liberty River estuary.The current DC Universe version of Gotham City is separated from the mainland by the Gotham River, bridged by a series of bridges and tunnels. The east and south sides of Gotham face the Atlantic Ocean. The city is further divided by the Sprang River (named for Dick Sprang) on the northern end and the Finger River (for Bill Finger) to the south. Tiny Blackgate Isle to the south-east is home to Blackgate Maximum Security Penitentiary. (Blackgate is replaced by Stonegate Penitentiary in the animated series \"Batman\" (1992) and its spin-offs.)"
