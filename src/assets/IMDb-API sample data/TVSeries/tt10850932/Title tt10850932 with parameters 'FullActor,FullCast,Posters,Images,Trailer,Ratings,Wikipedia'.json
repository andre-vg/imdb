Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin) is a member of the North Korean elite and a captain in the Korean People's Army. As he is patrolling, he meets Se-ri and saves her. Having decided to help her go back to the South, he hides her from other North Koreans, especially Cho Cheol-gang (Oh Man-seok) who is out to expose him. As they spend time together, they fall in love.\r\nPlot\r\nCrash Landing on You tells the story of two star-crossed lovers, Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin), a South Korean chaebol heiress to Queen's Group, and Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin), a member of the North Korean elite and a captain in Korean People's Army.\r\nOne day, while Yoon Se-ri is paragliding in Seoul, South Korea, a sudden tornado knocks her out and blows her off course. She awakens to find that her paraglider has crashed into a tree in a forest in the North Korean portion of the DMZ, an area forbidden for South Koreans. She then meets Ri Jeong-hyeok, who eventually gives her shelter and develops plans to secretly help her return to South Korea. Over time, they fall in love, despite the divide and dispute between their respective countries.\r\nBack in South Korea, Yoon Se-ri's family suppresses the news of her disappearance out of fear that it will depress the stock price of the chaebol. Just before Se-ri went missing, her retiring father informed his family that he intended to announce her as his successor based on her abilities as a businesswoman, as shown by her successfully building her own company, instead of her half-brothers, Se-jun and Se-hyung, who struggled managing the chaebol's subsidiaries. The brothers are supported by their equally-ambitious wives, Do Hye-ji (Hwang Woo-seul-hye) and Go Sang-ah (Yoon Ji-min), respectively. In Se-ri's absence, Se-hyung outmaneuvers his siblings through unscrupulous means to win the succession battle to lead the family firm, while Sang-ah attempts to take over Se-ri's company.\r\nSe-ri and Jeong-hyeok's story is intertwined with that of Seo Dan (Seo Ji-hye) and Gu Seung-jun (Kim Jung-hyun). Dan is the sophisticated daughter of a wealthy North Korean department store owner. She has been studying the cello in Russia for several years but returns to marry Jeong-hyeok, to whom she is engaged through an arranged marriage even though they have only met a few times. As she returns to Pyongyang, she crosses paths more than once with Gu Seung-jun, who had fled to North Korea (under the protection of corrupt North Korean officers) in order to escape from the pursuit of Se-hyung, under whose incompetent watch he had embezzled large amounts of money.\r\nThe first half of the story follows Jeong-hyeok's attempts to hide Se-ri and help her get back to South Korea. They are impeded by Cho Cheol-gang (Oh Man-seok), a corrupt and ruthless officer from the State Security Department, who had previously arranged for the murder of Jeong-hyeok's older brother, an officer who tried to expose him for his traitorous deeds against the North Korean regime. Jeong-hyeok's attachment to Se-ri distresses not only Dan, his fiancée, but also his father, who is a high-ranking political figure, as the discovery of Jeong-hyeok harboring a South Korean citizen could be used by rival officials to ruin their family's reputation.\r\nIn the second half of the story, Se-ri is able to return to South Korea and resume leadership of her company, surprising her family and others who had thought she was dead. While Cheol-gang is initially convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his crimes, he escapes custody through aide from his loyal soldiers and criminal network whereby he infiltrates South Korea to go after Se-ri. Despite opposition from his father who nevertheless reluctantly gives his support, Jeong-hyeok first arrives in South Korea discreetly before his soldiers are clandestinely sent to Seoul by Jeong-hyeok’s father to assist Jeong-hyeok in his aim to protect Se-ri from Cheol-gang's vengeance. Meanwhile, in North Korea, despite Seo Dan and Seung-jun's initial encounters being random and unpleasant, she shelters him when the corrupt officers betray him to Se-hyung's gangsters, and they eventually fall in love.\r\nCast\r\nMain\r\nHyun Bin as Ri Jeong-hyeokLee Chun-moo as young Jeong-hyeok Kim Seung-chan as teenage Jeong-hyeok\r\nLee Chun-moo as young Jeong-hyeok\r\nKim Seung-chan as teenage Jeong-hyeok\r\nSon Ye-jin as Yoon Se-riKim Tae-yeon as young Se-ri\r\nKim Tae-yeon as young Se-ri\r\nSeo Ji-hye as Seo DanPark Seo-yeon as young Dan\r\nPark Seo-yeon as young Dan\r\nKim Jung-hyun as Gu Seung-jun / Alberto Gu\r\nRecurring\r\nNorth Korean soldiers in Company Five\r\nYang Kyung-won as Pyo Chi-su, an acerbic Sergeant Major in Company Five, who enjoys drinking \"medicine\" on and off the job and antagonizing Se-ri because of his paranoia against South Koreans.

In September 2008, Yang and three others had to be rescued after bad fog had caused their leisure boat to drift \"into the maritime boundary between North and South Korea.\" Park Ji-eun, the drama's screenwriter, was introduced to North Korean defector turned film adviser and writer Kwak Moon-wan, who became part of the drama's writing team. Kwak, who studied film directing in Pyongyang and had also been a member of an elite security force protecting the Kims, helped in crafting the drama's plot and in conceptualizing the setting and scenes in the drama portraying North Korean life.\r\nNetflix's investment also helped the show to garner the budget of US$20 million.\r\nFilming\r\nThe production process proved to be \"painstakingly meticulous\", owing both to South Korea's relationship with North Korea (where most of the story's plot ensues), as well as to avoid any unintentional violations of the 1948 National Security Act which forbids public praise or propaganda of North Korea and the Kim Family. The script avoided use of the honorific Chairman to refer to North Korea's leaders, and visible propaganda signs avoid mentioning anything about Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, or Kim Jong Un (while their mandatory portraits were usually either blurred or obscured by the camera angles). In addition, the North Korean lapel pins used by North Korean characters were one third smaller than their actual size. Props manager Joo Dong-man said the crew did not have a \"guidebook on multiple hurdles he had to hop over – skillfully and delicately – to accurately depict the country while dodging criticism\" and, thus, had to be careful \"not to misrepresent the state\". Their research was also guided by North Koreans living in South Korea.\r\nThe first script reading took place on July 31, 2019, in Sangam-dong, Seoul, and filming overseas started at the end of August 2019. North Korean scenes were shot in South Korea and Mongolia. Scenes that took place in Switzerland were shot on location. The village of Iseltwald, one such location, experienced a tourism boom as a result.\r\nOriginal soundtrack\r\nThe following is the official track list of Crash Landing on You (Original Television Soundtrack) album. The tracks with no indicated lyricists and composers are the drama's musical score; the artists indicated for these tracks are the tracks' composers themselves. Singles included on the album were released from December 15, 2019, to February 16, 2020.\r\nChart performance\r\nReception\r\nCommercial performance\r\nWith 1.75 billion online views, Crash Landing on You outperformed the prior leader, Mr. Sunshine, for most viewed drama clips by 200 million views as of February 17, 2020. The success of the drama helped to boost brand items due to product placement. The lead characters portrayed by Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin ate Gold Olive Chicken, a product which had a 100% sales improvement due to the show. There was also an increase in sales of the Swarovski earrings worn by Son Ye-jin.\r\nInternational response\r\nCrash Landing on You was a huge success in China. The hashtag for the drama's final episode has received over 460 million views on Weibo. The drama's main streaming website, which holds the copyright in China, crashed on the night it aired the final episode due to the sheer number of users.\r\nThe show was also extremely popular in Japan during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic via Netflix. While the Korean Wave is a historically prominent component of media within Japan, Crash Landing on You has been uniquely influential there, in part due to its portrayal of daily life in North Korea. The series was featured on Japanese-Netflix's top 10 for an astonishing 69 consecutive weeks.\r\nIn the Philippines, many viewers noted similarities between the plot line and the political narrative of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nIn the United States, Variety named Crash Landing on You one of \"The Best International Shows on Netflix\", and one of the \"Best International TV Series of 2020.\" Time also ranked it as one of the best Korean dramas on Netflix. Elle ranked it number 1 (out of 10) on the October 2020 10 Best K-Dramas To Binge-Watch On Netflix list, and Vogue listed it as one of \"Netflix: 4 Korean dramas to discover this summer.\" Boy Genius Report ranked it #2 of the five \"K-dramas you absolutely must watch on Netflix.\" BuzzFeed listed it as number 3 of the top 27 best K-dramas on Netflix. Forbes noted that it ranked number 1 out of the top 10 on a Netflix's Instagram list of its most romantic series, and Screen Rant ranked it as having the #2 (out of the top 10) \"tear-jerking scenes in K-dramas.\" In addition, Jo Walker of The Guardian's \"Stream Team\" called it \"addictively off-the-wall, heartbreaking and hilarious.\" Adella Suliman and Stella Kim of NBC News also suggested that the drama \"features all the ingredients a viewer could wish for\" and has \"drawn a global audience of millions, many no doubt searching for entertainment as they while away their time in coronavirus-related lockdowns.\" Wadzanai Mhute of The Daily Beast argues that Crash Landing on You, \"was a cultural phenomenon in its native South Korea, and it's gone criminally overlooked in the States, where it's available to stream on Netflix.\" Megan O'Keefe of Decider states that, \"Crash Landing on You is a show unlike anything you've ever seen. It has insane action sequences, glorious montages of wealth porn, unblinking looks at the impoverished lives of everyday North Koreans, and one of the most heart-wrenching love stories in ages. With 16 90-minute-long episodes, it's truly a feast to be savored and the perfect antidote to the winter quarantine blues.\"\r\nAl Jazeera stated that it is a hallyu success.\r\nRepresentation of and reception in South and North Korea\r\nGeneral\r\nAlthough the series is a work of fiction, it has received some positive reviews from North Korean defectors for its depiction of everyday life in North Korea. At the same time, some details, such as the availability of food, relatively warm behavior of the army and the ease with which the characters cross the border have been criticized. Kim Ara, one of the extras who portrayed a North Korean villager, is a writer and actress from North Korea who states that she felt \"like was actually back in a North Korean village.\" Kwak Moon-wan, a North Korean defector, who had served with the Supreme Guard Command (which protects the ruling Kim family) worked as an adviser for the series, providing the writers with details about life in North Korea as well as North Korean governmental agencies that added credibility to the show. He acknowledged some of the criticism, admitting that he has taken liberties with the depiction of North Korea (such as not mentioning food shortages), but rejected the claim that he was glamorizing the regime or drawing a false equivalence, saying that the show also depicted some of the darker aspect of life under the regime, such as the issue of kotjebi (child homelessness) and the frequent power cuts. Some North Korean refugees, such as Chun Hyo-jin, who defected from the border village of Hyesan at the age of nineteen, tend to agree: \"Even if what they say, that it glamorizes North Korea, is true, would they choose to live there? I don't think so\". Even though the drama leaves political matters aside, which are essential to the North Korea issue as she sees it, she says it still is of great significance: \"Its depiction of North Korea is a bit far from reality, but it has made the people interested in North Korea\". The drama's producer Lee Jung-hyo said during a press conference in Seoul in December: \"I know some people are uncomfortable about our subject, North Korea, but we don't portray a wholly authentic North Korea in our drama. Most settings are closer to a fantasy, although some aspects do reflect real North Korean life\".\r\nKang Na-ra, a North Korean defector who advised the show's production team, stated that about 60% of North Korea's depiction in the show is accurate: \"The richer families in North Korea like to show off their wealth by adding lace curtains to their windows. So that was pretty well portrayed\". She also appreciated the detail about kimchi caves: \"Since rural North Korea doesn't get electricity, they don't have refrigerators. They have kimchi caves where they store kimchi, and that was also recreated well\". House checks are also a regular affair. She revealed that she once had to hide inside a furnace at the house of the broker who helped her to escape to avoid detection. In the drama, the heiress had to hide in the kimchi storage area when security forces came knocking one night. As depicted in the drama, North Koreans are allowed to choose only from a fixed list of hair styles - 18 for women and 28 for men. \"There's a punishment for you if you don't comply\" Kang said in an interview with YouTube channel DKDKTV. On the other hand, as she explained in a YouTube video, the characters were able to slip across the border much more easily than in real life: \"I had to pay a broker 10 million won (US$8,400) to swim across the Yalu river while being shot at from behind by soldiers\". Cartoonist Choi Seong-guk, who defected to the South in 2011, also said the drama set is 60% accurate. The portrayal of jangmadang, or local markets where all kinds of goods, including imports from South Korea, are sold is especially real, he told The Sunday Times. However, he felt that the drama \"glamorized the soldiers too much, almost to an uncomfortable extent\". He said North Korean men enter the military when they are 17 and serve for 10 to 13 years. \"During this time, they are...ruthless and harsh, robbing homes and raping women at night\". Still, he hopes the drama will make its way to North Korea and go viral: \"I hope the North Koreans who see this drama will realize how positively the South Koreans think of them and learn to change\".\r\nThere were also critical responses to the themes of the drama in both regions. In January 2020, The Christian Liberal Party (CLP) filed a complaint in South Korea against tvN at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, accusing the network of glamorizing North Korea through this series, in violation of the National Security Law. Then, in March 2020, a few North Korean media outlets criticized unnamed South Korean programs and films that explored relations between North and South Korea. While Crash Landing on You was not directly mentioned by the media outlets, it was perceived to be among the referenced works. Another is the 2019 film, Ashfall, although that film was also not directly cited in the articles.\r\nScholarship\r\nStephen Epstein (Victoria University of Wellington) and Christopher Green (Leiden University) suggest that while Crash Landing on You is formulaic, it also \"is a crucial text for evaluating ongoing change in South Korean popular representations of its neighbour. Indeed, given the concerted use of North Korean backdrops in Crash Landing on You and the size and global extent of its audiences, the show is likely the most noteworthy South Korean popular culture representation of North Korea yet produced.\" Yun Suk-jin, a professor at Chungnam National University concurs, noting that the series \"changed the stereotypes on North Korea and candidly showed that it too is a place where people live.\" Sarah A. Son, Lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Sheffield also agrees, noting that Crash Landing on You responds to the \"socio-cultural divide\" between the North and the South, which academic scholarship cites as one of the biggest obstacles to future unification. Son argues that \"through the re-framing of stereotypes, albeit with some creative licence, Crash Landing on You arguably humanises the North for its audience in ways that inter-Korean dialogue has not in recent years. Despite its soft-focus romanticisation of the political situation, Crash Landing on You brings the pain of the division to a personal level for a generation of Koreans who, unlike their grandparents, have no memory of what it was like to be a single nation.\"\r\nJoanna Elfving-Hwang, Associate Professor of Korean Studies at the University of Western Australia notes that \"North Korea tends to appear in our imagination as the 'axis of evil', we think of nuclear weapons and human rights abuses...this drama has dared to think about North Korean people differently and represented them as quite human and quite Korean.\" Steve Hung Lok-wai, a Korean Affairs expert from the Chinese University of Hong Kong states that the drama sidestepped larger political issues through a narrative that did not end with the male lead's defection: \"Lots of people questioned whether the male lead, the North Korean soldier, would end up defecting to the South for love, but they were able to sidestep that scenario and gave it a plausible ending where the two would meet in Switzerland\". Thus, he argues, it's \"quite smart because they avoided all the real taboos but made it believable enough where it would make people think about these political problems.\" John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University, praised the series for its decision to draw parallels between powerful families in both the South and the North, and to humanize North Koreans beyond generic stereotypes.\r\nRatings\r\nThe series was a huge rating success in South-Korea. This series aired on tvN, a cable channel/pay TV which normally has a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC and EBS). Crash Landing on You is the fourth highest-rated South Korean TV drama in cable television history. Early in its run, Crash Landing on You was the fourth highest rated Korean cable drama. The final episode's ratings made it the second highest rated Korean drama in cable television history at that time, surpassing fellow tvN dramas Reply 1988 and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God, until It finally became the fourth highest rated drama, surpassed by both JTBC drama, The World of the Married and Reborn Rich .\r\nAccolades\r\nIn May 2020 the show's scriptwriter, Park Ji-eun, was named \"Person of the Year\" by South Korea's Unification Ministry, for contributing to \"unification education.\"\r\nMusical adaptation\r\nOn March 29, 2021, it was announced that Crash Landing on You would be adapted into a musical and the production companies Pop Music and T2N Media had completed a global copyright contract with Studio Dragon. The musical was performed at the Shinhan Card Artium, COEX, Gangnam-gu, Seoul from September 16 to November 13, 2022.",

In September 2008, Yang and three others had to be rescued after bad fog had caused their leisure boat to drift \"into the maritime boundary between North and South Korea.\" Park Ji-eun, the drama's screenwriter, was introduced to North Korean defector turned film adviser and writer Kwak Moon-wan, who became part of the drama's writing team. Kwak, who studied film directing in Pyongyang and had also been a member of an elite security force protecting the Kims, helped in crafting the drama's plot and in conceptualizing the setting and scenes in the drama portraying North Korean life.</p><p>Netflix's investment also helped the show to garner the budget of US$20 million.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>The production process proved to be \"painstakingly meticulous\", owing both to South Korea's relationship with North Korea (where most of the story's plot ensues), as well as to avoid any unintentional violations of the 1948 National Security Act which forbids public praise or propaganda of North Korea and the Kim Family. The script avoided use of the honorific Chairman to refer to North Korea's leaders, and visible propaganda signs avoid mentioning anything about Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, or Kim Jong Un (while their mandatory portraits were usually either blurred or obscured by the camera angles). In addition, the North Korean lapel pins used by North Korean characters were one third smaller than their actual size. Props manager Joo Dong-man said the crew did not have a \"guidebook on multiple hurdles he had to hop over – skillfully and delicately – to accurately depict the country while dodging criticism\" and, thus, had to be careful \"not to misrepresent the state\". Their research was also guided by North Koreans living in South Korea.</p><p>The first script reading took place on July 31, 2019, in Sangam-dong, Seoul, and filming overseas started at the end of August 2019. North Korean scenes were shot in South Korea and Mongolia. Scenes that took place in Switzerland were shot on location. The village of Iseltwald, one such location, experienced a tourism boom as a result.</p><br/><h3>Original soundtrack</h3><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th colspan=\"2\" class=\"infobox-above summary album\" style=\"font-style: italic; background-color: gainsboro; font-size: 125%;\">Crash Landing on You<br>(Original Television Soundtrack)</th></tr><tr><th colspan=\"2\" class=\"infobox-header description\" style=\"background-color: gainsboro\"><span>Soundtrack album</span> by <div class=\"contributor\" style=\"display:inline\">various artists</div></th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" class=\"infobox-label\">Released</th><td class=\"infobox-data published\">February 16, 2020</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" class=\"infobox-label\">Recorded</th><td class=\"infobox-data plainlist\">2019–2020</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" class=\"infobox-label\"><span>Genre</span></th><td class=\"infobox-data category hlist\"><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1129693374\"><div class=\"hlist\"><ul><li><span>Soundtrack</span></li><li><span>Ballad</span></li><li><span>K-pop</span></li></ul></div></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" class=\"infobox-label\">Length</th><td class=\"infobox-data\"><span class=\"duration\"><span class=\"min\">104</span>:<span class=\"s\">48</span></span></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" class=\"infobox-label\">Language</th><td class=\"infobox-data category\"><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1129693374\"><div class=\"hlist\"><ul><li>Korean</li><li>English</li></ul></div></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\" class=\"infobox-label\"><span>Label</span></th><td class=\"infobox-data hlist\"><span>Stone Music Entertainment</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" class=\"infobox-below\"><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1066479718\"></td></tr><tr><th colspan=\"2\" class=\"infobox-header\" style=\"background: gainsboro\"><span>Singles</span> from <i> Crash Landing on You </i></th></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" class=\"infobox-full-data\"><div style=\"text-align:left\"><ol><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"But It's Destiny\"</span><br>Released: December 15, 2019</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"Flower\"</span><br>Released: December 22, 2019</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"Sunset\"</span><br>Released: December 29, 2019</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"Here I Am Again\"</span><br>Released: January 12, 2020</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"Someday\"</span><br>Released: January 19, 2020</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"Photo of My Mind\"</span><br>Released: January 25, 2020</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"The Hill of Yearning\"</span><br>Released: January 26, 2020</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"All of My Days\"</span><br>Released: February 1, 2020</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"Like You\"</span><br>Released: February 2, 2020</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"Let Us Go\"</span><br>Released: February 9, 2020</span></li><li><span class=\"item\"><span class=\"fn\">\"<span>Give You My Heart</span>\"</span><br>Released: February 16, 2020</span></li></ol></div></td></tr><tr style=\"display:none\"><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The following is the official track list of Crash Landing on You (Original Television Soundtrack) album.

online views, Crash Landing on You outperformed the prior leader, Mr. Sunshine, for most viewed drama clips by 200 million views as of February 17, 2020. The success of the drama helped to boost brand items due to product placement. The lead characters portrayed by Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin ate Gold Olive Chicken, a product which had a 100% sales improvement due to the show. There was also an increase in sales of the Swarovski earrings worn by Son Ye-jin.</p><h4>International response</h4><p>Crash Landing on You was a huge success in China. The hashtag for the drama's final episode has received over 460 million views on Weibo. The drama's main streaming website, which holds the copyright in China, crashed on the night it aired the final episode due to the sheer number of users.</p><p>The show was also extremely popular in Japan during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic via Netflix. While the Korean Wave is a historically prominent component of media within Japan, Crash Landing on You has been uniquely influential there, in part due to its portrayal of daily life in North Korea. The series was featured on Japanese-Netflix's top 10 for an astonishing 69 consecutive weeks.</p><p>In the Philippines, many viewers noted similarities between the plot line and the political narrative of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>In the United States, Variety named Crash Landing on You one of \"The Best International Shows on Netflix\", and one of the \"Best International TV Series of 2020.\" Time also ranked it as one of the best Korean dramas on Netflix. Elle ranked it number 1 (out of 10) on the October 2020 10 Best K-Dramas To Binge-Watch On Netflix list, and Vogue listed it as one of \"Netflix: 4 Korean dramas to discover this summer.\" Boy Genius Report ranked it #2 of the five \"K-dramas you absolutely must watch on Netflix.\" BuzzFeed listed it as number 3 of the top 27 best K-dramas on Netflix. Forbes noted that it ranked number 1 out of the top 10 on a Netflix's Instagram list of its most romantic series, and Screen Rant ranked it as having the #2 (out of the top 10) \"tear-jerking scenes in K-dramas.\" In addition, Jo Walker of The Guardian's \"Stream Team\" called it \"addictively off-the-wall, heartbreaking and hilarious.\" Adella Suliman and Stella Kim of NBC News also suggested that the drama \"features all the ingredients a viewer could wish for\" and has \"drawn a global audience of millions, many no doubt searching for entertainment as they while away their time in coronavirus-related lockdowns.\" Wadzanai Mhute of The Daily Beast argues that Crash Landing on You, \"was a cultural phenomenon in its native South Korea, and it's gone criminally overlooked in the States, where it's available to stream on Netflix.\" Megan O'Keefe of Decider states that, \"Crash Landing on You is a show unlike anything you've ever seen. It has insane action sequences, glorious montages of wealth porn, unblinking looks at the impoverished lives of everyday North Koreans, and one of the most heart-wrenching love stories in ages. With 16 90-minute-long episodes, it's truly a feast to be savored and the perfect antidote to the winter quarantine blues.\"</p><p>Al Jazeera stated that it is a hallyu success.</p><h4>Representation of and reception in South and North Korea</h4><h4>General</h4><p>Although the series is a work of fiction, it has received some positive reviews from North Korean defectors for its depiction of everyday life in North Korea. At the same time, some details, such as the availability of food, relatively warm behavior of the army and the ease with which the characters cross the border have been criticized. Kim Ara, one of the extras who portrayed a North Korean villager, is a writer and actress from North Korea who states that she felt \"like was actually back in a North Korean village.\" Kwak Moon-wan, a North Korean defector, who had served with the Supreme Guard Command (which protects the ruling Kim family) worked as an adviser for the series, providing the writers with details about life in North Korea as well as North Korean governmental agencies that added credibility to the show. He acknowledged some of the criticism, admitting that he has taken liberties with the depiction of North Korea (such as not mentioning food shortages), but rejected the claim that he was glamorizing the regime or drawing a false equivalence, saying that the show also depicted some of the darker aspect of life under the regime, such as the issue of kotjebi (child homelessness) and the frequent power cuts. Some North Korean refugees, such as Chun Hyo-jin, who defected from the border village of Hyesan at the age of nineteen, tend to agree: \"Even if what they say, that it glamorizes North Korea, is true, would they choose to live there? I don't think so\". Even though the drama leaves political matters aside, which are essential to the North Korea issue as she sees it, she says it still is of great significance: \"Its depiction of North Korea is a bit far from reality, but it has made the people interested in North Korea\". The drama's producer Lee Jung-hyo said during a press conference in Seoul in December: \"I know some people are uncomfortable about our subject, North Korea, but we don't portray a wholly authentic North Korea in our drama. Most settings are closer to a fantasy, although some aspects do reflect real North Korean life\".</p><p>Kang Na-ra, a North Korean defector who advised the show's production team, stated that about 60% of North Korea's depiction in the show is accurate: \"The richer families in North Korea like to show off their wealth by adding lace curtains to their windows. So that was pretty well portrayed\". She also appreciated the detail about kimchi caves: \"Since rural North Korea doesn't get electricity, they don't have refrigerators. They have kimchi caves where they store kimchi, and that was also recreated well\". House checks are also a regular affair. She revealed that she once had to hide inside a furnace at the house of the broker who helped her to escape to avoid detection. In the drama, the heiress had to hide in the kimchi storage area when security forces came knocking one night. As depicted in the drama, North Koreans are allowed to choose only from a fixed list of hair styles - 18 for women and 28 for men. \"There's a punishment for you if you don't comply\" Kang said in an interview with YouTube channel DKDKTV. On the other hand, as she explained in a YouTube video, the characters were able to slip across the border much more easily than in real life: \"I had to pay a broker 10 million won (US$8,400) to swim across the Yalu river while being shot at from behind by soldiers\". Cartoonist Choi Seong-guk, who defected to the South in 2011, also said the drama set is 60% accurate. The portrayal of jangmadang, or local markets where all kinds of goods, including imports from South Korea, are sold is especially real, he told The Sunday Times. However, he felt that the drama \"glamorized the soldiers too much, almost to an uncomfortable extent\". He said North Korean men enter the military when they are 17 and serve for 10 to 13 years. \"During this time, they are...ruthless and harsh, robbing homes and raping women at night\". Still, he hopes the drama will make its way to North Korea and go viral: \"I hope the North Koreans who see this drama will realize how positively the South Koreans think of them and learn to change\".</p><p>There were also critical responses to the themes of the drama in both regions. In January 2020, The Christian Liberal Party (CLP) filed a complaint in South Korea against tvN at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, accusing the network of glamorizing North Korea through this series, in violation of the National Security Law. Then, in March 2020, a few North Korean media outlets criticized unnamed South Korean programs and films that explored relations between North and South Korea. While Crash Landing on You was not directly mentioned by the media outlets, it was perceived to be among the referenced works. Another is the 2019 film, Ashfall, although that film was also not directly cited in the articles.</p><h4>Scholarship</h4><p>Stephen Epstein (Victoria University of Wellington) and Christopher Green (Leiden University) suggest that while Crash Landing on You is formulaic, it also \"is a crucial text for evaluating ongoing change in South Korean popular representations of its neighbour. Indeed, given the concerted use of North Korean backdrops in Crash Landing on You and the size and global extent of its audiences, the show is likely the most noteworthy South Korean popular culture representation of North Korea yet produced.\" Yun Suk-jin, a professor at Chungnam National University concurs, noting that the series \"changed the stereotypes on North Korea and candidly showed that it too is a place where people live.\" Sarah A. Son, Lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Sheffield also agrees, noting that Crash Landing on You responds to the \"socio-cultural divide\" between the North and the South, which academic scholarship cites as one of the biggest obstacles to future unification. Son argues that \"through the re-framing of stereotypes, albeit with some creative licence, Crash Landing on You arguably humanises the North for its audience in ways that inter-Korean dialogue has not in recent years. Despite its soft-focus romanticisation of the political situation, Crash Landing on You brings the pain of the division to a personal level for a generation of Koreans who, unlike their grandparents, have no memory of what it was like to be a single nation.\"</p><p>Joanna Elfving-Hwang, Associate Professor of Korean Studies at the University of Western Australia notes that \"North Korea tends to appear in our imagination as the 'axis of evil', we think of nuclear weapons and human rights abuses...this drama has dared to think about North Korean people differently and represented them as quite human and quite Korean.\" Steve Hung Lok-wai, a Korean Affairs expert from the Chinese University of Hong Kong states that the drama sidestepped larger political issues through a narrative that did not end with the male lead's defection: \"Lots of people questioned whether the male lead, the North Korean soldier, would end up defecting to the South for love, but they were able to sidestep that scenario and gave it a plausible ending where the two would meet in Switzerland\". Thus, he argues, it's \"quite smart because they avoided all the real taboos but made it believable enough where it would make people think about these political problems.\" John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University, praised the series for its decision to draw parallels between powerful families in both the South and the North, and to humanize North Koreans beyond generic stereotypes.</p><h4>Ratings</h4><p>The series was a huge rating success in South-Korea. This series aired on tvN, a cable channel/pay TV which normally has a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC and EBS). Crash Landing on You is the fourth highest-rated South Korean TV drama in cable television history. Early in its run, Crash Landing on You was the fourth highest rated Korean cable drama. The final episode's ratings made it the second highest rated Korean drama in cable television history at that time, surpassing fellow tvN dramas Reply 1988 and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God, until It finally became the fourth highest rated drama, surpassed by both JTBC drama, The World of the Married and Reborn Rich .</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover
