How the hell are these TVF writers not getting proper recognition for their work... This is simply outstanding work from them.. Series after series they are producing gems which we as human beings can only just applaud to.. Starting from pitchers, permanent roommates,tripling, yeh meri Family, immature and then KOTA FACTORY.. I know everyone is telling that tvf is trying to give stiff competition to amazon & netflix but i think it's vice versa.. Amazon & netflix are trying to give stiff competition to tvf....They may not have the resources to show mammoth battles or big fat Indian weddings but they certainly have the writing prowess to make you cry, laugh,be sad, happy,nostalgic all at the same time."

Kota factory is well made, well acted and primarily tells the story of students who are stuck for two years in Kota's coaching town in hope to crack IIT exams. This rat race for engineering has ruined lives of thousands of students and this madness still is on. Hopefully people can connect to this amazing show and we can watch mainstream movies from TVF soon."

Responsible for Pitchers and Permanent Roommates, the channel has now presented another show in the form of Kota Factory."

      "title": "Jeetendra Kumar And Mayur More Shine In This Must-Watch Sequel About IITians' Challenges !!!",
      "content": "The second instalment picks up from where its debut season had left off, with Vaibhav Pandey (Mayur More) switching from Prodigy Coaching Class to Maheshwari Coaching Class, as the latter is a better institution when it comes to IIT coaching. The story revolves around Vaibhav's, his friends', and classmates' mental anguish as they prepare for the IIT entrance exams. Will they give up or will they triumph in the most important struggle of their lives ?Created by Saurabh Khanna and Arunabh Kumar and written by Abhishek Yadav, 'Kota Factory' is set in the ultra-competitive student ecosystem of Rajasthan's Kota, a place where vulnerability and trauma abound for students preparing for the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). This sequel, too, is one-of-a-kind, thanks to its spot-on humour and relatable existential struggle experienced by the protagonist.The first season of 'Kota Factory' follows Vaibhav Pandey, a teenager who enrolls in a coaching institute that prepares students for the IIT entrance exam. His friends and competitors, Balmukund aka Meena (Ranjan Raj) and Uday (Alam Khan), gradually assist him in adjusting to this high level of academic pressure. However, near the end of the season, Vaibhav clears Maheshwari's admission entrance exam and is torn between his heart and mind about whether or not to enroll in the best coaching center in town, which has a high success rate. The second season, on the other hand, picks up right where the first had left off, chronicling the protagonist's trials and tribulations, particularly after he has to adjust to a new learning culture in Maheshwari after leaving his friends and love interest Vartika (Revathi Pillai) behind. Will he be able to persist in the face of such adversity, or will he succumb to the pressure? That is the question that the creators are attempting to answer.Directed by Raghav Subbu, this five-part 'black and white' series highlights the issues that IIT-JEE aspirants face in their day-to-day lives. It gets viewers emotionally invested in the students' journey and the guidance of their one and only physics teacher, Jeetu Bhaiya (Jeetendra Kumar), who serves as a modern-day Dronacharya for them. The narrative eloquently depicts a wide range of emotions, including optimism, angst, love, companionship, and even doubting one's own life choices-whether they truly want to follow the course that appears to be carved out for them, or if they can forge their own path. Briefly, the narrative does emphasise the importance of family support as well as the difficulties faced by youngsters who are unable to cope with the competitive pressure. However, the creators should have paid a little more attention to the delicate aspect of students contemplating quitting in order to give the plot a larger perspective.Overall, the series stands out by providing high-octane emotional scenarios that are complemented by a well-crafted background score. Additionally, meaningful songs like Amit Trivedi's 'Main Lad Lunga' provide depth to the character's emotional agony. Without being too dark to watch, the close-up shots convey a sense of the claustrophobic environment as seen through the eyes of students.Similar to the previous season, Jitendra Kumar plays a pivotal role in the show. As teacher, mentor and supervisor, Jeetu Bhaiya is the only one who understands the students' problems and encourages them to confront them. Even his motivational talks, such as \"don't dream, always aim; since dreams are imagined and aims are to be achieved,\" leave an impression.Mayur More plays Vaibhav to perfection. His character is primarily shown overcoming the challenges of fierce competition, which is exacerbated by his own shortcomings. Mayur shares great on-screen chemistry with his friends Meena and Uday, who are played by Ranjan Raj and Alam Khan, respectively. While everyone's performances are consistent, Raj's character, Meena, steals the show once again, especially when he is dealing with his adolescent hormones. His innocent one-liners infuse the show with the required humour.Ahsaas Channa, as the medical student Shivangi Ranawat, has a significant role in this season, assisting and serving as a support system for the group of students. Vartika, played by Revathi Pillai, has a minor role, but her on-screen chemistry with Vaibhav is endearing enough for audiences to remember.Like its predecessor, this season of 'Kota Factory' perfectly captures the students' vulnerability while also highlighting the burgeoning coaching industry, which views its students' victories as a marketing campaign for their institutes. Overall, the production is highly motivating, with a compelling story and outstanding performances that make this satire a must-watch."

      "content": "I was in the middle of binge-watching all the web series on TVF Play when this came (I prefer calling shows like this web series and the ones on Netflix and Prime TV-shows). I was trying my best to finish Pitchers so that I could move on to this. I had seen too many memes and saw all my friends sharing the stories on WhatsApp about them watching the last episode. So finally when I got the chance to watch this, I did it immediately. Kota Factory is probably the best web series that TVF has made so far, and that's saying something provided Yeh Meri Family also exists.Kota Factory is a story set in Kota, where a number of students come every year to study for JEE Advanced. Everyone comes over there only with the hopes that they are going to become an IITian one day. As someone who also wanted to visit this city during my 11th class, I can very well understand what it feels like to be there. In the scene where Vaibhav is caught cheating from a book and Jeetu Bhaiya scolds him, I actually felt it right through my heart. I got an AIR 173 and got to DTU, so you can understand how much I had to struggle to get where I am, and hearing the things he said reminded me of my own days at the coaching centre.There are so many things that feel really relatable in this web series. The way Vaibhav adjusts to the PG life, the entire character of Meena, the teachers at the coaching centre and how they try to look as enthusiastic as possible to keep the students engaged; it's all just like how we get to see people in 11th and 12th class. My school was one of the biggest schools of India, so students from all over the country used to come to study with us. When I look at Meena and Uday, it reminds me of them; the two kinds of students that used to be there.The only problem I had with this series is how it was made in black and white. There's no problem with making a black and white show, but in this series they just slapped a greyscale filter on this. There was no contrast, the camera quality was very bad and the certain areas that need to be given special application for greyscale effect was not done at all (if you've watched Logan: Noir or Zack Snyder's Justice League: Justice is Gray you'll know exactly what I'm talking about).Kota Factory is a social commentary that belongs to something I like to call the 'era-defining entertainment', something that people from the future can watch to understand what life was like in our times, and the fact that we actually wanted to change them. I use this term to define films and shows like Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, Zootopia, Watchmen etc. I really appreciate the fact that TVF Play is a free streaming service, so this masterpiece will be available to everyone without having to spend money."

Kota factory on TVFplay is a show about a handful of students preparing for the premier entrance exams for those spots through the coaching centre's based in Kota, Rajasthan.Kota factory uncovers most of the problems faced by these students right from the politics behind admissions, placement of batches, living conditions, study materials, quality of teachers, internal politics of the coaching centres, Marketing techniques, teaching methods, freedom, campus fleecing, friendships, student lifestyle and tons of other problems faced by these poor kids.Acting of Jitendra Kumar as jeethu Bhaiya a swashbuckling teacher was outstanding. Most of student's acting were natural and good. The show is shot in black & white, which adds a contour on the dull lives of the students. Direction, editing and cinematography were decent and Songs were top notch. Shooting in the real location has really helped the outlook of the show. A chemistry rant by the lead, Vibhav in episode 3 was simply outstanding.The web series is a much watch for all the Lakhs of students and ex-students who studied in the hundreds of coaching centres in Kota and elsewhere. But it must be duly noted that all work and no play will make students dull and sorry to say that the students of Kota look dull. In my opinion, for a perusal of a better life, a lot of the parents don't hesitate to destroy their kid's lives. The failure and rejection would be too much for the young kids to handle. I wish the makers had brought this up too instead of marketing the Unacademy app in the series."

Everything has a meaning including the black and white scheme of the series... Which describes a rather colourless and one dimensional life of a student who has been living with blinders.
