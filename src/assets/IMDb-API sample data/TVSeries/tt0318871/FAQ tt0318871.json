    },
    {
      "question": "Is Berserk based on a book?",
      "answer": "Berserk is based on a Japanese comic series (manga) written by Kentaro Miura. It was first published in 1989 and it's still on going."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does something happen after the ending of the last episode? (episode 25)",
      "answer": "Those who watched the series since the first episode know that something happened after the end of episode 25, since episode 01 works more like a sequel to episode 25. However in the actual Berserk timeline (following the manga series) there's a lot of story which takes place after episode 25 and before episode 01 and they are only shown in the manga series."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did they end the series?",
      "answer": "During the pre-production of the series the original idea was to adapt the entire berserk manga series from start to finish (even though the manga story was still on going), however, there was not enough budget to make an adaptation of the first manga chapters, so the only way was to try to sum it up in only one episode, which wasn't the pilot that the producers where expecting. During the production, there weren't enough manga chapters to make a second season after the first 25 episodes, so the studio decided to create only one season with an ending connecting the beginning of the series. Even with the series having a good success with its 25 episodes some fans where disappointed with adaptation of the first volumes to the pilot."

    {
      "question": "Where can I find the original manga?",
      "answer": "Berserk is published in the USA by Dark Horse Comics."

      "question": "Since Guts appears in the first episode, how did he manage to escape The Eclipse?",
      "answer": "In the manga, after chapter 102 (the one where the anime ends), the Skull Knight (character not shown in the anime series) manages to break into the demonic vortex to rescue Guts and Casca."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened to Guts and Casca after they were rescued from The Eclipse?",
      "answer": "Both were rescued from The Eclipse chaos and brought to safety by Skull Knight (a character not in the anime). Casca lost her mind however through a form of post-traumatic stress. Guts decided to go away alone on a journey for revenge against Griffith and all apostles who serve him.Reading the manga from the first chapter is of course the best way to find out."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to Griffith after The Eclipse?",
      "answer": "Griffith turned into a member of the mysterious God Hand, becoming a demon with great powers. He then sets out to achieve his dream of reaching that castle and becoming a ruler."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Femto rape Casca?",
      "answer": "Mainly out of revenge against Guts, as he felt Guts had betrayed and abandoned him. He wanted to make Guts feel the darkest of despair. The rape also symbolizes Griffiths descent away from humanity, and his quest to exert power over people."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Casca get pregnant after having sex with Guts or after being raped by Femto?",
      "answer": "Yes, in the end of volume 13 it is shown that she not only got pregnant but also gave birth to a premature baby human-demon hybrid. It was probably a mixture of Guts and Caska DNA plus Femto's essence of evil (his semen). The baby looks more like a small vermin-fetus creature, it vanishes at daylight but it can be seen in the darkness (like caves or during the night), and sometimes it appears to protect Casca from danger and to warn Guts about the demons."
