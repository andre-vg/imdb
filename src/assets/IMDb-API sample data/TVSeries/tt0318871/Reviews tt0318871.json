However, Berserk changed my entire attitude towards animation. Brilliantly written, insanely intriguing character development, and while some say the ending is too abrupt, I believe that it was one of the most powerful and poignant finishes to a series i've seen. Very few series actually leave the viewer wishing they could find a way to see the next season, and Berserk does so brilliantly. However, this is not for the faint of heart, I would definitely not advise this for children under 13, since it contains graphic everything. Can't find any faults except there is no season after this one, and would suggest it to anyone trying to discover new anime."

      "content": "Berserk is by far the best anime that I have ever seen. Nothing even comes close to capturing the interest of the viewer and holding it tightly throughout the ten hour duration of this masterpiece. Firstly, I must admit that it has its flaws, such as a few points of lazy animation, as in some of the battle scenes, as well as the somewhat disappointing ending, which leaves the viewer thirsting for more without the promise of any follow-up. Yet the fact of the matter is, and I speak for myself, that the positive aspects of Berserk outweigh the bad so drastically one cant help but overlook them in terms of the entire film. The frequent sub-par visuals mean nothing in comparison to the amazing plot depth and beautiful character development marbled throughout the film. In summary, Berserk is a ten hour mini-series that consists of 25 20+ minute episodes detailing the life of a rogue swordsman named Guts. Guts, in short, is simply the most intriguing fictional character ever constructed. Guts, first of all, is one of the finest examples of an individual driven entirely by self preservation and improvement. Throughout the series Guts grows stronger and more deadly before our eyes, with each thrust of his massive sword. The personal relationships that he develops over time, especially with Griffith and Caska, are totally believable and honest. In particular, the love/hate relationship that Guts has with Caska sucks the viewer into their world and with each episode end leaves you literally thirsting for more. I can honestly say that I had never so anxiously awaited a release as I did with each progressing volume. The score, other than being entirely redundant, creates an additional emotional appeal that quite literally leaves a mark in your mind. The opening theme song, although an acquired taste, becomes somewhat of a necessity to mark the beginning of each additional episode that will bring you deeper into the world of Guts and the Band of the Hawk. In no time at all you find yourself singing along with it as if it were a top forty tune. The climactic theme played every 3 episodes or so, is absolutely haunting, leading one to wonder how it came to be included in an anime. Berserk is a definite must-see for all fans of anime. For those who dislike anime or are indifferent to it, the mediocre visuals may tarnish your opinion of it, yet the rock solid plot and character depth with leave you amazed. Rating: Animation Quality: 7/10 Character Development: 10/10 Plot Line: 10/10 Overall Enjoyment: 12/10 (If that's at all possible)"

In the end it's the story that gets you hooked, with pretty well defined characters and interesting plot twists.I especially liked how you can definitely find a character to identify with, even if it is not the main character. You start understanding why some things happened a few episodes before and why some of the things will happened next. Unfortunately the story ends with a HUGE twist, without any hope of continuation, which leaves you wanting.I have watched a few anime series start to end these days, including Hellsing, Tsukihime, Elfen Lied, but I liked Berserk a lot more than any of them. Unfortunately I don't have the patience to read the comics, so I guess this is where the story ends for me. I wish they would do more episodes.Again, I noticed this series described as horror. There is no horror within, except maybe the last episode, but it is moving something inside for sure. Watch it."

I watched the entire series on my computer over a three day period during which I had school and extracurricular activities to attend. Although I did not have any extra time to spare during the days I stayed up all three nights watching episode after episode unable to break away from the most engrossing anime series created.I am not going to spoil anything but will tell you that the series features some of the most interesting characters i have ever experienced. Although the animation is rarely top notch and the voice acting isn't always perfect i still found myself captivated by each and every second of the series. If you value plot and don't mind flagrant amounts of violence and some nudity this is definitely and anime series for you. If you have ever liked anime or enjoy more medieval types of live action films even you should give Berserk a try.P.S. after watching the series you should definitely check out the forums or the manga, it will make you feel a lot better i promise.Overall 10/10 for an incredible experience, despite some technical flaws. Watch Berserk as soon as you can, you will not regret it!"

However, the story and sheer sense of tragedy in the show is rarely seen in animation, Japanese or not.Berserk is memorable, over the top at times, but always watchable. Its pacing is universally appealing and there's a good sense of tension and unpredictability. this is an anime that can be appreciated as a television show, not just an animation show.Please give this 90s gem a watch."

(Believe it or not, this anime actually covers the most tamed part of the source material: It's only at the very final episodes where the series becomes as just as brutal as the original comics)While I highly recommend this series, keep in mind the plot often deals with some disturbing issues like child abuse and rape, and also I must warn you the plot ends in one big cliffhanger (Which manages to be shocking even though considering the very fist episode foreshadows the tragic conclusion taking place after the 25th episode)\"Berserk\" is definately not a happy ride, but is a definately a must-see for anime fans."

      "content": "The plot of Berserk is purely the stuff of pulp fiction novel series: a young man with a talent for killing falls in with a group of super-mercenaries, and with them, grows into the most lethal warrior of his time. However, it's done as well as it can be here. At first, Berserk seems crude beyond belief. It's certainly not brilliantly scripted, and the animation isn't top quality, but it grows on you remarkably fast. The European medieval setting makes the intensely bloody action and philosophical musings seem more natural, and character of Guts is solid enough to give some substance to the series as a whole. He's pure killing power, untempered by reflection or remorse. But as the series goes on, he learns some responsibility and compassion. It doesn't happen in some sudden epiphany, but gradually. Also, a lot of his history is revealed in flashbacks. We learn the unflinching truth of how he became so unfeeling.So overall, Berserk is definitely worth seeing. It's character driven in spite of its intense violence, and it has some genuine emotions in spite of its hardcore narrative cruelty."

Berserk is, without a doubt in my mind, one of the most gripping and powerful pieces of entertainment you will ever watch. The animation, even though it is very old, holds up beautifully and fits the overall theme perfectly. I really like the main-ish song that has become somewhat of a meme and i heard it long before I even thought about watching the Anime. Guts is a wonderful protagonist who doesnt have a super complex backstory, nor does he display some unimaginable intellect. Instead, he is a lost soul searching for the meaning of his life, his only companion being an extremely oversized sword. However, there is something magic about him, something so likeable and the sheer amount of raw emotions that are bottled up in this character, and his thoughts, are undescribable. He is the embodiment of a powerful but emotional man struggling with destiny.I CANNOT recommend this enough. Please do yourself a favor and watch Berserk. Read the manga afterwards if you liked it, because there is more to the universe than this. I will probably do the same, but i will need to watch some puppy videos for a couple days first."

      "title": "Not an anime fan, yet I highly enjoyed this.",
      "content": "Berserk is, to say the least, phenomenal. I love the dark fantasy setting, the artwork is AMAZING, seriously, there are shots of beautiful paintings of medieval architecture, beautiful landscapes, barren wastelands etc. Not to mention the visceral detail (e.g. The plethora of bloodshed and dismemberment) which adds to the violent dark fantasy theme of this show.The relationships between the characters, particularly the ones between Guts, Griffith, and Casca are interesting and well-developed, as they become closer to each other and also become more open. Guts is a badass main character, going from a young mercenary owned by a highly skilled mercenary leader (Griffith) to a mature and almost undefeatable warrior owned by demons. Berserk actually starts off by showing us how Guts is after all his years in the Band of the Hawk, then transitions to a younger, less experienced Guts, so you see this amazing contrast at the start of the show. You also learn more about Guts' past, as well as Casca's and Griffith's, which helps you understand how they ended up being the way that they are throughout most of the show. Themes of morality and aspiration are also well explored.This show, despite its pluses, does of course have its negatives. For starters, the animation isn't great. For example, sometimes there are just still frames with the characters' mouths moving up and down to resemble talking, other times when there's combat, you see a still frame of Guts swinging his sword and sometimes afterwards a very brief death animation for the victim but considering the time and budget constraints that the studio had, it makes sense that they'd have to take shortcuts. Another negative I have is that after more than two decades of the final episode, there is no second season. I've heard of a continuation in the story that was made in 2016-2017, but from what I've heard it's disappointing, particularly due to the art and animation, which is a huge shame, since if the same studio had continued the story using the new manga material that had been released for Berserk since the late 90's, using the same art-style but better quality animation to create a continuation of Guts' riveting tale, I would've watched it in a heartbeat and Berserk fans would've loved it. What a missed opportunity, but ah well, I guess 25 episodes will have to do for now, I might read the manga too."

      "title": "Medieval kingdoms, big swords, frenzied warriors, gore, nude, sex, intrigue, betrayal, demons, a quest for vengeance, and an ending that was screaming for a sequel",
      "content": "1) The pilot episode. It ain't shitting around with a slow build up. It begins at a point in the future where the lead character is already somehow betrayed and mutilated by his best friend, and he is on a quest to kill the sucker. The very first episode tells you with a scene from the future how the world became a dark and morbid place, where the people live in fear and demons have crawled in powerful positions of authority, toying sadistically with innocents. It is an extremely powerful plot device to hook you for what is about to follow or not. The second episode is actually the story told from the start, as we gradually see how the protagonist grows up in the battlefield, gets more powerful, wields bigger swords (I mean, REALLY bigger swords), how he makes allies, friends, lovers, and enemies. You already know how all that will have a bad outcome because of the pilot episode so you are easily interested to see how all that happened. 2) Gore, splatter, nude and sex. This almost goes without needing an explanation. Sex and violence always sell and this anime has buckets of it. Sounds like brain-dead superficial entertainment but unlike most shows Berserk is only using them as attraction and not as definition. Because to be honest, most heavy on action and/or nude series are usually nothing without these elements while Berserk works fine even without them. Plus, it uses a form of violence that is quite appealing to me; hand-to-hand and sword-to-sword battles between frenzied armored warriors. Using magic or lasers to do the same just doesn't look raw enough.3) Interesting characters. The main three characters are interesting, even if there wasn't a ton of violence and gore in the show. You gradually see them revealing all their inner thoughts to you, their pasts, their goals, their desires and hopes. You see them getting beaten, learning from their mistakes, maturing, being broken by betrayal and coming out more crazy than what they already were. Plus, the aforementioned violence is used to bring out their weak side and hidden thoughts. 4) Political power struggles. The show is not centered on a team of warriors, strolling a generic kingdom and doing stand-alone missions. The world they live in has affected them and is affected back by them, all part of Griffith's goal to leave his mark on the world by getting his own kingdom. Along the way many aristocrats get annoyed by his continual successes and fearing their own agendas to be stolen by him continually try to assassinate him. And he reacts by plotting his own assassinations. All of which happen in secrecy, while the kingdom is at war with its neighbors. So it is not a story about a few brave warriors protecting their good homeland by invading monsters; it is a simple war of political agendas between local kings for whom gets to have all the lands for himself. And not only that; it is also about the internal double crossing the aristocrats do to one another every time one wants to steal the glory from the other. 5) Atheistic take on humanity. Although religion is a topic hardly mentioned directly in anime, over here it is openly trampled as nothing more than a false ideal to hide one's dark desires. It is extremely interesting how the show uses ideals and hopes as means for clergy and ambitious leaders to control their underlings. This was never done before so openly. It even goes as far as claiming how all the demons in the show are in reality people willing to sacrifice everything in order to fulfill their desires, even if it means losing their humanity and killing everyone they love. I really liked how monsters are not treated as generic incarnations of evil or plain misguided mortals; they are shown to be the pure form of ambition liberated by the constraints of morality, emotions and ideals. 6) Psychological symbolisms and imagery. Many parts of the show, usually those involving demons, are full of WTF sceneries, all of which have to do with basic carnal desires and fears. Unlike most shows with demonic dimensions, which are nothing but generic depictions of torture of the damned, here all the monsters and their Eclipse world are directly attributed to their personalities having been given in completely to their desires. The characters are not scared of getting crazy because of them. Heck, they are mostly terrified of becoming like that as well. Not because it is bad or wrong, but because it feels inappropriate for any human being to end up like that. Which is again very interesting as a concept. Cliffhanger ending. This is a part most hate about the show, as it ends in the most exciting and agonizing way possible. But in reality, that is also a plus of the show as it is almost demanding from you to read the manga just to see what happens next. The animators had lots of sloppy moments inserted in the show and most of them have to do with lack of animation and repeated footage and not with bad drawings. The drawings are in fact great. The music score is amongst the most blood boiling pieces of grudge rock and orchestrated epic music even made and easily tops even the animation part of the show. The characters have really appropriate voice actors with no stupid pitches in voice. Even the sound effects were successful, as simple as they may have been. Bottom line, Berserk is fine dark fantasy material, with great action and story and characters. The manga version is of course continuing the story far more than where the anime stops and features far more gore and sex scenes."

It's not movie-score like music either. It's definitely not for everyone, as far as just listening to it goes (but I must say I've developed a liking for Susumu Hirasawa's work), but most of it fits quite well (although with the rampant re-use it's bound to not work sometimes), and some of it is great regardless what it's presented with. \"Behelit,\" and \"Forces\" being the real stand-outs, both in terms of being listenable, AND in terms of reuse with varying degrees of appropriateness. The opening theme does suck though. No question. (In stark contrast to the end credits song, which, while also being an abomination of Engrish, sounds perfect.) I used to be really into anime. I fell out of it a few years ago, and stopped giving a crap about almost all the anime I'd ever seen or heard of. But as all the chaff blew away, this was one of the few grains to remain. It's unforgettable, especially if you watch the whole series in order. It's unspeakably grim when viewed as a whole, but contains a growing optimism throughout most of the series. There are only a tiny handful of animes which can stand beside Berserk in the quality of their storytelling. Hell, only a small portion of ANY fiction can be compared favorably to it. Berserk is not just good anime, it's good drama. If you like the fantasy genre in any format, you must see this show. If you like stories about people growing through hardship, you must see this show. If you like stories about unrelenting badasses, you must see this show. If you don't care about anything but eye candy, or you're an anime dork looking for wank-fuel, look elsewhere. Berserk may not have something for EVERYONE, but it has something for MOST people."

Normally he doesn't work with others but after meeting the enigmatic Griffith he joins his mercenary group; the Band of the Hawk. They fight alongside each other and the Hawks have more and more success in battle. This makes Griffith one of the king's favourites which upsets the aristocracy who believe he is getting above himself. Over the course of the series the group fight numerous battles and much blood is spilt. We also learn more about Guts and Griffith's pasts. Obviously it isn't all fighting; there is an element of romance involving Casca; the second in command of the Hawks.If you like your anime packed with lots of bloody violence then this is the series for you. Guts might not be a jolly protagonist but the way he swings his huge sword means he is entertaining. The other main characters are entertaining; especially Griffith and Casca. The numerous battles and skirmishes are all exciting even though they aren't all fully animated. Occasionally things do get a little disturbing; most notably when a group of enemies try to rape Casca and towards the end of the series when the band find themselves in a demonic landscape; these scenes mean it isn't really a suitable series for younger viewers. The story, which is actually shown in flashback is gripping and at no point did I feel bored or feel that the story was dragging and at the end I just sat stunned; to say it is shocking is an understatement to figure out just who survived I may have to watch the opening episode again!These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles."

I can almost smell the setting.The music is amazing (the opening is one of my new favorites) and the visuals are great, despite its more limited animation.I'm really pleasantly surprised by its slow pace. It really takes its time to develop the characters and spend time with them.Those last three episodes are absolutely insane.It's so good."

      "title": "The absolute Best Anime I have seen to date!!",
      "content": "Some of my favorite things to watch are stories that take you on more than a 2 hour simple journey and instead lead you on an epic tale. This is great in that aspect. The first episode left me thinking it would be only similar to all other anime I have watched - good, but nothing exstatic. However, from the second episode forward it only got better and better until an unbelievable climatic ending. I love the midievil aspect rather than the usual sci-fi, or goth (vampire) themes. The three main characters, Guts, Griffith, and Caska - are excellent, and by the time the series nears the end you really know each of these characters individually, meaning you can feel their pain and hopes. All around, this is a superb film, and I can only pray every day that they make a second series since this one ends making you crave for more - ends on a cliffhanger so to speak. I'd love to see Guts' further adventures and what would happen with his relationship with Griffith/Femmto."

      "content": "I just finished watching Berserk for the second time in my life. This time it felt different than the first but one thing remained: Berserk made me feel strong emotions once again.This is a very tricky anime to deal with. The story is excellent, the characters are excellent and the flow of the series is excellent. Kingdoms Chudor and Midland are fighting in a 100 years long war against each other. A war that is now fought only because it is a war, neither side can hardly remember why the war started. Guts is a young mercenary, who gathers attention with his phenomenal fighting skills with his huge sword. After a battle, he encounters a band of mercenaries who try to steal his gold he gained from his battle. It appears that the mercenary group had been fighting with the opposite side that Guts fought. Guts handles the attack, but when the leader of the mercenaries, Griffith challenges him, he loses. After resting, Guts wants a rematch with Griffith with following terms: If Guts wins, he can walk away and if Griffith wins, he can do whatever he wants with Guts. Ultimately Griffith wins - again - and forces Guts to join his group of mercenaries, The Band of the Hawk. That is where their journey together begins, Griffiths journey to world domination...Of course, this is only the beginning of the whole story but it is futile to tell it any further here. Berserk has three main characters: Guts, Griffith and Casca, the female captain of The Band of the Hawk. And I have to say, that the chemistry between these three characters is one of the most interesting ones I have ever witnessed in any story. They have very different personalities that react with each other very unpredictably. Guts is a man who has learned to live his life through battles, he knows nothing else but the adrenaline and it's temptation in the battlefield. Griffith is a charismatic leader who aims for only one goal: his dream of becoming the king of the world. No. Matter. What. Casca is a women whose life changed when Griffith saved her when she was just a girl. She has followed Griffith ever since, becoming a strong warrior in the process.But this is only the surface. All of these characters become different in the viewers eyes with each passing moment. As the series evolves, Guts, Griffith, Casca and even all the other characters (Corcus, Pippin, Judeou etc.) change and reveal surprising elements of their inner self. It is very fascinating to watch how the love - hate relationship between Casca and Guts evolves and to what direction or how Griffith goes extreme making his actions very questionable and his motives difficult to analyse. It is interesting to watch the electricity between Guts and Griffith, how Griffith becomes dependable on Guts and how ultimately Guts pulls all the strings. Everything Guts does affects Griffith. Guts makes Griffiths ascending towards his dream possible and Guts has the power to ruin it all.It is also very fascinating to see all the philosophical aspects of Berserk. Each person is what he/she is for a reason and these reasons define what these persons live for. Sometimes they don't know why they do what they do or why they live their lives. And in the times of desperation they question their motives and desires, not surely knowing what they want from life. The thoughts of these persons make you wonder your own existence as well and the meaning of your life. Does it have a meaning? Does it have to have? Or do we live here just because we live here? If a series can make me think these kind of questions, I believe it has achieved more value than just entertainment...Yes, Berserk truly is very deep in a realistic way. The watcher becomes one with the characters as the series goes on. All the philosophical aspects combined with the ruthless violence and darkness makes Berserk truly an amazing series. But the thing that makes this series so unique is it's ending. All of you who have watched this series know from what I'm talking about. The original story of Berserk doesn't end where this anime ends (and I have not read the manga...Not yet) and since there will be no second season, this anime stands for it's own. The ending makes me mad. It makes me sad, shocked, petrified, horrified...In a good way. I can still remember when I watched berserk for the first time, I couldn't believe the ending, it was so shocking! NOBODY can end a series like this, this makes even Twin Peaks's ending look soft. It is actually heartbreaking to watch the last two episodes of Berserk, when you have jumped in to the worlds of these characters...Everything they ever made, everything they achieved becomes nothing, and the high hopes for the future (after difficult times) are crushed in a blink of an eye. Not a happy ending, not in a million years...Every anime friend, you have to watch Berserk. It is deep, dark, violent and philosophical view to all sides of human nature and the motives to actions that lurk beneath. Berserk holds many different world views and personalities, but makes every action and decision understandable from the aspects of each character. Guts's violent nature, Cascas varying actions, Griffiths ascending towards his dream, they all are explained in a realistic way, trough different motives. I can even understand why Griffith chose to become Femto, no matter how heartless and cruel decision it was. Berserk is absolutely magnificent anime, that makes you wonder and question many things, even in real life."

      "content": "EDIT: RIP Kentaro Miura...Dont watch the dubbed version. Get the original japanese with subtitles or you will ruin it.This was hands down, one of the best animes ever made. And that is despite the fact that it had limited funding and the animation was not the best. The story telling is superb as you follow the lives of a group of mercenaries who rise to every challenge they are hired to do no matter how improbable. It centers on three main characters, a cold and calculating leader (Griffith), his loyal lieutenant (Casca) and the hot blooded warrior (Gutts) who wanted no part of joining them but was indentured to them via a reckless bet. You also get to know a bunch of minor characters who are important to the mercs.You follow them around for 24 episodes (note that 1st episode is misleading) as the commander tries to build his own army and build his own kingdom. But this is not a happy hero show, its a bit more realistic. There is plenty of satisfying fighting but also awkwardness, tragedy, espionage and luck (both good and bad).In many ways the story makes a great effort to make the show believable and you wont see any clean cut heroes in this one. Yet you still can understand them even when they do wrong. You will run into some demons and magic here and there but it is not the focus of the story which is why I say the 1st episode is very misleading since it makes you think that its a show about the supernatural.This show is a lot like Game of Thrones and predates GoT by more than a decade. Like GoT it has supernatural elements but they are not really the focus. The focus is on the characters and their struggle and I argue the characters here are much better."

      "content": "\"Berserk\" is simply one of the best action anime series ever made.It had all the fun and excitement of series such as \"Lodoss\", though it was done from a much grittier perspective.It's interesting to notice how the original \"Berserk\" anime only a had a few fantasy elements, having a \"realistic\" (but effective) approach of this story, which combined very well elements from epic and horror stories, resulting in something unique (At least for television) It had plenty of action, interesting characters and a fascinating background, that gave the story an incredibly appeal. The animation was reasonable well made, despite having some obvious limitations, the overall result was still pretty effective. The designs of the characters and sceneries were excellent, with many details and more mature aesthetic that gave this an \"edgier\" approach than other fantasy anime series with a more light-hearted tone.\"Berserk\" kept a good level from the very beginning of the story, until the end of it. In fact, the ending left me wanting to see more about this story (Specially considering that this anime doesn't cover all the plot from the original comics) Now that some new \"Berserk\" movies are being made, it was nice experience for me to re-watch this series, and I'm glad to say that this survived the test of time.I just hope that someday all the whole great story done by Kentaro Miura get adapted into an animated format, considering how good it is it. But I'm sure that this will remain as the best adaptation."

      "content": "Dark and gritty, not something for children as it full with bloods and violences. Tons of action and creepy scenes. The hand-drawn animation style suits the best for the horrofic yet entertaining storyline. Great attention to details and love the inclusion of rough sketches quite often. The storyline is straight forward - going on adventure to hunt monsters and collecting artifacts/medallions, while seeking for revenge. Classic rpg esque execution of monsters hunting. A bit of LGBT representations and POC - Some bad some good. Not a fan of the flow as it heavily featured on the past/flashback, theres flashback in the flashback of a flashback which was really ridiculous for me after the strong episode 1 debut.Great characters design and some were very disturbingly good. Great characters development and skill sets. Marvelous sound scores, giving a very haunted mansion vibe, setting up a very dark adult-horror tone.Perfect voice castings but not a huge fan of the odd choices in the flow of the animation (as it was being skipped sometimes). Marvelous sound scores/tracks. The songs were totally okay - opening song was catchy and very punk pop rock but for me it doesnt suit the tone of the animation & the ending song was creepy & hauntingly good.The commentary on the intro was perfect and very relatable to many. Again this is not for kids. Highly recommended."

Upon seeing this anime I had been blown away by the sheer magnitude of story, characters, etc. I loved it.This anime is one of the best ones I have seen. The story and Characters were developed over time all 25 episodes not just the first 3 or 4 as is typically found. The story raised the same emotions of excitment that FF7 did when I first played it.I really wish the ending would have been different, but it only meant that more is to come. I am really hoping that they decide to do a 2nd season of Berserk, if they don't I'll just have to get my hands on the manga that everyone has been talking about.Overall the series is very good. there are minor flaws in the animation at times but for the most part its smooth sailing."
