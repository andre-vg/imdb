      "question": "What happened to Zuko's mother?",
      "answer": "Fire Lord Ozai confirmed that he banished Zuko's mother and that she may still be alive, but it is unsure. In the series finale, Fire Lord Zuko questions his father on the whereabouts of his mother, but the series ends before it is confirmed that she was found. Zuko finding Ursa was actually storyboarded for the finale by Avatar Director Joaquim Dos Santos, but was nixed by Mike DiMartino - not really sure why but this implies that Ursa most likely is alive. In 'The Legend of Korra' the children of Tenzin asks their grandmother, Katara, to tell the story about Zuko's mother, although she was willing to tell the full story, she got interrupted before telling the story.However, a comic titled 'The Search' was released by Nickelodeon in 3 parts in 2013. The events take place between the end of 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' and 'The Legend of Korra'. We learn that Ursa, Zuko's mother, returned to her home village of Hira'a after being banished by Ozai. There she found the man whom she was engaged to, Ikem, before being taken away to become Ozai's wife. She then learns of a spirit named The Mother of All Faces, and searches for her to receive a new face, and the spirit also removes almost all memories of her past life. When Zuko learns who his mother is now and finds her, The Mother of All Faces returns Ursa's original face and memories."
