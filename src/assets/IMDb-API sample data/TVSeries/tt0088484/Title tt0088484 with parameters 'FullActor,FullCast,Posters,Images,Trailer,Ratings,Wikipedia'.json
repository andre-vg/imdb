      "plainText": "Blackadder II is the second series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, which aired from 9 January 1986 to 20 February 1986. The series is set in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603), and sees the principal character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder, as a Tudor courtier attempting to win the favour of the Queen while avoiding execution by decapitation, a fate that befell many of her suitors.\r\nThe series differed markedly from The Black Adder, notably with Ben Elton replacing Rowan Atkinson as the second writer, filming in studio sets, rather than on location, the introduction of a Machiavellian \"Blackadder\" character and a less intelligent Baldrick.\r\nPlot\r\nThe series is set during the Elizabethan era (1558–1603). The principal character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), is the great-grandson of the original Black Adder, and is now a member of the London aristocracy. Unlike his forefather, he is both dashing and intelligent, although he is still scheming and cynical in his outlook. The series follows his attempts to win the favour of the childish Queen Elizabeth I (Miranda Richardson). As before, he is aided, and often hindered, by two less-than-intelligent sidekicks, his servant Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny), heir to the Duchy of Northumberland, with whom Blackadder has a grudging friendship.\r\nThroughout the series, Blackadder's chief rival is Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry), the Queen's pretentious and grovelling Lord Chamberlain. Melchett fears upsetting the Queen, and thus attempts to outdo Blackadder by supporting the Queen in whatever current fad she is interested in. Comic relief in the Court is provided by the Queen's demented former nanny, Nursie (Patsy Byrne).\r\nBaldrick, who in the first series was the most intelligent of the main trio, became more stupid, an idea proposed by Ben Elton to make him \"the stupidest person in the history of...human beings\", and to act as a foil to Blackadder's new-found intelligence. The series was also the originator of Baldrick's obsession with the turnip, although this apparently arose from a botanical error on the part of Elton, who confused the vegetable with the \"amusingly shaped\" parsnip.\r\nLord Percy remained similar in character to the original series, as a foolish sidekick in Blackadder's plots and predicaments. In this respect, McInnerny said the character resembled Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. As with The Black Adder, the series featured many tongue-in-cheek references to Shakespeare's plays; Shakespeare is mentioned as a contemporary Elizabethan, and his famous quotations are twisted for comic effect. The first episode \"Bells\", follows a similar plot to Twelfth Night.\r\nEpisodes\r\nThe series aired for six episodes broadcast on Thursdays on BBC 1 at 9.30pm between 9 January 1986 and 20 February 1986.\r\n\"Head\" was originally intended to be the first episode and was first to be filmed. This resulted in the small continuity error of Lord Percy still having a beard in \"Head\" which he shaves off in \"Bells\". In addition, during the early scenes of \"Head\", the principal characters are introduced to the audience with Baldrick's stupidity highlighted.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nDue to the high cost of the first series, Michael Grade (the then controller of programming of BBC 1) was reluctant to sign off a second series without major improvements and cost-cutting, leaving a gap of three years between the two series.\r\nRowan Atkinson did not wish to continue writing for the second series, so writer and stand-up comedian Ben Elton was chosen to replace him. According to producer John Lloyd, Ben Elton was particularly keen on the choice of the Elizabethan age for the series, because it was \"a sexy age that the kids can relate to.\" As a stand-up comic, Elton often acted as the studio warm-up comic to amuse the audience before filming began. The scripts were also tightened up during principal rehearsals with the actors; according to Richard Curtis, an entire script for a murder mystery-style episode was dropped because the writers felt it did not work.\r\nFilming\r\nTo make the show more cost-effective, it was principally filmed on specially designed small sets at BBC Television Centre created by designer Tony Thorpe. The sets were de-constructed and rebuilt during the period of studio filming, as was normal for studio series then. In particular, the Queen's throne room and Blackadder's front room were featured in every episode, with only two further unique sets per episode, including an execution chamber in \"Head\" and a Spanish dungeon in \"Chains\". Only one outside location shoot was used in the whole series, which took place before principal filming on Thursday 30 May 1985 at Wilton House, Wiltshire. These outdoor scenes were Blackadder's courting scene in \"Bells\" and the end title sequences. Studio recordings shot in front of a live audience began on Sunday 9 June 1985 with the recording of \"Head\". Subsequent episodes were filmed on a weekly basis in the sequence \"Bells\", \"Potato\", \"Money\", \"Beer\" and \"Chains\". Director Mandie Fletcher was keen for the action to be shot spontaneously and was averse to complex costume changes or special effects which required recording to be halted.

      "html": "<p>Blackadder II is the second series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, which aired from 9 January 1986 to 20 February 1986. The series is set in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603), and sees the principal character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder, as a Tudor courtier attempting to win the favour of the Queen while avoiding execution by decapitation, a fate that befell many of her suitors.</p><p>The series differed markedly from The Black Adder, notably with Ben Elton replacing Rowan Atkinson as the second writer, filming in studio sets, rather than on location, the introduction of a Machiavellian \"Blackadder\" character and a less intelligent Baldrick.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>The series is set during the Elizabethan era (1558–1603). The principal character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), is the great-grandson of the original Black Adder, and is now a member of the London aristocracy. Unlike his forefather, he is both dashing and intelligent, although he is still scheming and cynical in his outlook. The series follows his attempts to win the favour of the childish Queen Elizabeth I (Miranda Richardson). As before, he is aided, and often hindered, by two less-than-intelligent sidekicks, his servant Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny), heir to the Duchy of Northumberland, with whom Blackadder has a grudging friendship.</p><p>Throughout the series, Blackadder's chief rival is Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry), the Queen's pretentious and grovelling Lord Chamberlain. Melchett fears upsetting the Queen, and thus attempts to outdo Blackadder by supporting the Queen in whatever current fad she is interested in. Comic relief in the Court is provided by the Queen's demented former nanny, Nursie (Patsy Byrne).</p><p>Baldrick, who in the first series was the most intelligent of the main trio, became more stupid, an idea proposed by Ben Elton to make him \"the stupidest person in the history of...human beings\", and to act as a foil to Blackadder's new-found intelligence. The series was also the originator of Baldrick's obsession with the turnip, although this apparently arose from a botanical error on the part of Elton, who confused the vegetable with the \"amusingly shaped\" parsnip.</p><p>Lord Percy remained similar in character to the original series, as a foolish sidekick in Blackadder's plots and predicaments. In this respect, McInnerny said the character resembled Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. As with The Black Adder, the series featured many tongue-in-cheek references to Shakespeare's plays; Shakespeare is mentioned as a contemporary Elizabethan, and his famous quotations are twisted for comic effect. The first episode \"Bells\", follows a similar plot to Twelfth Night.</p><br/><h3>Episodes</h3><p>The series aired for six episodes broadcast on Thursdays on BBC 1 at 9.30pm between 9 January 1986 and 20 February 1986.</p><p>\"Head\" was originally intended to be the first episode and was first to be filmed. This resulted in the small continuity error of Lord Percy still having a beard in \"Head\" which he shaves off in \"Bells\". In addition, during the early scenes of \"Head\", the principal characters are introduced to the audience with Baldrick's stupidity highlighted.</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr style=\"color:black;text-align:center\"><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#FFE135;width:5%\"><abbr title=\"Number\">No.</abbr><br>overall</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#FFE135;width:5%\"><abbr title=\"Number\">No.</abbr> in<br>series</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#FFE135\">Title</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#FFE135\">Directed by</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#FFE135\">Written by</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#FFE135\">Original air date</th></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep7\" style=\"text-align:center\">7</th><td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td><td class=\"summary\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"<span>Bells</span>\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><span>Mandie Fletcher</span></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><span>Richard Curtis</span> &amp; <span>Ben Elton</span></td><td style=\"text-align:center\">9 January 1986</td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"7\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #FFE135\"><p>Blackadder gains a new young servant, <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Bob</span>, and somehow falls for him.

According to producer John Lloyd, Ben Elton was particularly keen on the choice of the Elizabethan age for the series, because it was \"a sexy age that the kids can relate to.\" As a stand-up comic, Elton often acted as the studio warm-up comic to amuse the audience before filming began. The scripts were also tightened up during principal rehearsals with the actors; according to Richard Curtis, an entire script for a murder mystery-style episode was dropped because the writers felt it did not work.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>To make the show more cost-effective, it was principally filmed on specially designed small sets at BBC Television Centre created by designer Tony Thorpe. The sets were de-constructed and rebuilt during the period of studio filming, as was normal for studio series then. In particular, the Queen's throne room and Blackadder's front room were featured in every episode, with only two further unique sets per episode, including an execution chamber in \"Head\" and a Spanish dungeon in \"Chains\". Only one outside location shoot was used in the whole series, which took place before principal filming on Thursday 30 May 1985 at Wilton House, Wiltshire. These outdoor scenes were Blackadder's courting scene in \"Bells\" and the end title sequences. Studio recordings shot in front of a live audience began on Sunday 9 June 1985 with the recording of \"Head\". Subsequent episodes were filmed on a weekly basis in the sequence \"Bells\", \"Potato\", \"Money\", \"Beer\" and \"Chains\". Director Mandie Fletcher was keen for the action to be shot spontaneously and was averse to complex costume changes or special effects which required recording to be halted. She is reputed to have said filming it was \"a bit like doing Shakespeare in front of an audience – it's not at all like doing sitcom.\"</p><h4>Cast</h4><p>The size of the principal cast was reduced compared to the previous series, with a fixed number of characters appearing in every episode. Richard Curtis has been quoted as saying that due to the familiar cast, the series was the happiest for him to work on, comparing it to a \"friendly bunch of school chums\".</p><ul><li>Rowan Atkinson as Lord Edmund Blackadder</li><li>Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy Percy, Heir to the Duchy of Northumberland</li><li>Tony Robinson as Baldrick</li><li>Miranda Richardson as Queen Elizabeth I of England</li><li>Stephen Fry as Lord Melchett, the Lord Chamberlain</li><li>Patsy Byrne as Nursie</li></ul><p>The series also featured at least one significant cameo role per episode.
