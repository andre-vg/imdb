      "question": "How does the dictionary survive when it is thrown into the fire?",
      "answer": "If you watch the episode again, you'll see that Dr Johnson brings in two books, however the second one is supposed to be \"Edmund: A Butler's Tale\" which gets thrown into the fireplace as soon as he leaves. So, how did the dictionary survive? Well, perhaps he did have a copy after all..."

      "question": "Is the series historically accurate?",
      "answer": "Mostly, yes. But there are some mistakes:"

      "question": "Are \"aardvark\" and \"sausage\" really missing from Samuel Johnson's dictionary?",
      "answer": "There's no \"aardvark\", but there is a definition for \"sausage\":Sáusage. n.s. [saucisse, French; salsum, Latin.] A roll or ball made commonly of pork or veal, and sometimes of beef, minced very small, with salt and spice; sometimes it is stuffed into the guts of fowls, and sometimes only rolled in flower."

    {
      "question": "Does Mrs. Miggins also appear in Blackadder II?",
      "answer": "No, but she's mentioned two times; first in Potato, where she's revealed to be bedridden from the nose down. Later, she's mentioned in Money. Apparently, she owns a pie shop in that series, unlike in Blackadder the Third, where her descendant, played by Helen Atkinson-Wood, runs a coffee shop."

    {
      "question": "Who drew the opening title cards?",
      "answer": "Those covers were drawn by Stan Kaminski, here is his website, scroll down a bit and you should see them all (except for cover for Dish and Dishonesty, which was lost): http://www.stankaminski.com/galleries/black-adder/ The illustration for Nob and Nobility was missing the old font, so they tried to fix it via Microsoft Word. At least that's what the page looked like before the redesign. Now, both the illustrations for Dish and Dishonesty and Nob and Nobilityare missing from the site."
