      "question": "Why does Compound V create so many radically different superheroes if it is the same formula given to every subject?",
      "answer": "Because identical twins aside, no Human being has a one hundred percent DNA match with another. Given how variable Human responses to other chemical formulas are, there is no reason to believe the same chemical would produce identical results in all those into whom it is injected."

      "question": "Please explain Becca's relationship with Billy and how Homelander fits into all of this?",
      "answer": "Becca was Billy's wife. She vanished and he was told she was dead. He knew the superheroes are responsible, thus his mission for revenge: the whole reason for the show. What he did not know is that Homelander had raped Becca. She found out that she was pregnant. She knew that if Homelander knew and knew where to find her, Homelander would never leave her alone. Hence, Vought employees that she complained to fabricated a story about her dying in childbirth. They told Billy she was dead. Vought hid her and her son in a compound in an effort to make sure Homelander never learned of their deception or where she was.The last few episodes of season one show Homelander uncovering the truth, killing a number of people in the process."

      "question": "Why do animal shows seem to be playing on the tv's in various episodes?",
      "answer": "They play a role in the story, for example early on they show a turtle scene in a television which explains how the shell may be hard, however between that the turtle is quite fragile, the boys at that point get an idea on how to defeat their enemy at the time."

      "question": "Season 2: When The Deep is bailed out during episode one, a very sticky-looking fluid appears to be stuck between the bench and his butt. What is this? Does it have to do with his aquatic nature?",
      "answer": "This is a fluid secreted by fish to make them more hydrodynamic. People who handle fish caught for food can tell you that fish out of water are incredibly slimy."

      "question": "During her audition tape, Starlight asks when did hopeful and naïve become the same thing. Is this deliberate satire on the writers' part?",
      "answer": "Given the world we live in and how violent Humans have been to one another since they diverged from other primates, it is highly likely that the writers were having a big laugh at another superhero trope (ie Superman)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When Homelander flippantly decides to abandon the plane, he mentions something about not having a \"fulcrum\". What does this mean?",
      "answer": "This writer cannot accurately describe the physics of fulcrums and the role they play in mechanics, so take this as you will. A fulcrum in this context is something like an opposing force with which the object being pushed can be steadied. Hence Homelander's statement that the plane will flip over. It is a bit like a see-saw with one seat holding a small animal and the other having a rocket engine attached to it.It is important to understand that Homelander is not lying. This is a satire of the Superman trope in which Superman keeps planes safe by grabbing the pylon of the destroyed engine and flying along with the plane, as seen in the 1978 Superman film. The closest that any Superman film has come to showing the overgrown boy scout saving a plane realistically is in Superman Return, where Superman pushes up against the plane whilst standing on the ground before slowly tilting the rest of the plane onto the ground.Whether Homelander could have helped guide the plane to land on the water at a safe speed is unclear, but the laws of physics relating to force and fulcrums make this unlikely. Again, the small animal versus rocket thing, the rocket being Homelander's incredible strength and complete lack of care in moderating it. This is a rare instance of Homelander being practical rather than merely letting his antisocial personality disorder call the shots."

      "question": "What is Stormfront saying at the end of the fight in the final episode of season two?",
      "answer": "Stormfront is reminiscing.\"It was so beautiful. How the three of us sat there, in the shade of an apple tree. Do you remember the day Frederick? Chloe's arms out of the car window. We found the perfect spot by the river, in the shade of an apple tree. It was the first time Chloe ate fresh apples.\"Given that Stormfront is addressing Fredrick as if he is before her, she is likely suffering from shock."
