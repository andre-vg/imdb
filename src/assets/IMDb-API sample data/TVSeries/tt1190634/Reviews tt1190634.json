      "content": "There's nothing more that I can really say about The Boys that hasn't already been said. It's just a flat out awesome show! It's easily become one of my favorite new shows in years! I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them again for the second time before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a little bit of a drop off for Season 3 because Season 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop in quality but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can not recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching it it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"

      "content": "I've had big expectations about this show, because I thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show, in which the good guys (the superheroes) fight the bad guys (the villains) and of course, they win. I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because \"The Boys\" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, \"The Boys\" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching."

Season 3 was fantastic, Jensen Ackles was the perfect actor to add to this already incredible show! This show continues to amaze as it's not afraid to try new things and is a show that is definitely for adults. It has no problems being offensive and making you feel squeamish. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show. Season 4 just added Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the cast. Another great addition to an already incredible cast. I don't know what else I can say except I absolutely love this series and can't wait for more to come!"

      "title": "A superior 'Superhero' series",
      "content": "This Amazon series is set in a world where there are superheroes; they aren't typical superheroes though; they work for the powerful Vought Corporation and consider ratings and profit to be more important than saving lives. They are also arrogant, disillusioned or generally unpleasant. The worst of these are 'The Seven', the most senior heroes who are heavily marketed by Vought. Working to expose them is a group known as 'The Boys'; led by Billy Butcher who is convinced that leader of the heroes, Homelander, is responsible for the disappearance of his wife. We are introduced to each group via new members; Hughie Campbell joins The Boys after ultrafast hero A-Train ran through his girlfriend; and Annie January an idealistic young heroine known as Starlight who joins The Seven. Hughie and Annie become friends before learning what the other is doing.When I first heard of this I thought it was just a case of Amazon jumping on the superhero bandwagon but then heard a radio review which made it sound like a series I might like... it most certainly is! If you like your heroes to be heroic and good rather than self-centred egomaniacs you might not like this but if you like to see conventions turned on their head this is great. Another major difference between this and more typical stories featuring superheroes is that this is definitely not family friendly; there is a lot of strong violence, some sex and nudity and possibly the most swearing I've heard in a TV show. The story develops well over the two seasons that are currently available with some good twists and plenty of interesting character development. The characters on both sides are interesting and the cast does a great job portraying them. While the story can be a bit dark at times it is lightened by its humour; often being genuinely hilarious as we see events that wouldn't seem the most obvious source of laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to older superhero fans who are looking for something different. I can't wait for season three."

But this scrip is so freaking impressive, the over the top violence and gore along with great dialogues and brilliant acting easily brings it to the top. i would be really surprised if the two KIWI lead protagonists, Kurl Urban and Anthony Starr wouldn't get nominated for best actors in a leading role, specially Starr. He was absolutely brilliant as the lead antagonist Homelander. That says something for a superhero movie, wouldn't you say !Was waiting patiently for this show, and living up to that hype was not easy. Had to binge it at once, it's that addictive. Wow! Before even release, Amazon Prime ordered a second season even though the production cost might have been astronomical I would imagine. They were that confident, this was that good. Watch it, you'll enjoy !!"

Great special effects. Over the top violence. Even drama and a dark commentary on what society would really do if it had superheroes. And, unlike a lot of shows, The Boys doesn't lag in its following seasons. If anything it gets better. Watching this show is not an effort. It's a pleasure. It's an addiction. Yes, I'm saying it's that good. Why should you watch this show? Just start watching, and within the very first few seconds you'll want to see more. It's everything a show should be. And there's Karl Urban's use of the C word. Must be seen to be understood, but he does it as well and as often as Al in Deadwood. And that's saying a lot!"

I think season 1 is basically perfect, season 2 is a bit of a mess but I still enjoyed it, and season 3 is really good. The one major complaint I have across all three seasons though is that the commentary on corporations is hypocritical coming from Amazon, but that's not the writers' faults. I also want to mention the acting. It's great all around, but Karl Urban in particular is just fantastic. I think Billy Butcher might be the best role of his career."

      "content": "(Review updated after Season 3).Hughie Campbell's life is turned upside down when the love of his life is accidentally killed by a superhero, a member of The Seven, the most elite and adored of superhero teams. The Seven are the rock stars of the age and untouchable but the more Hughie investigates, the more he discovers they're far from perfect. His moral crusade sees him drawn into a band of anti-superhero vigilantes: The Boys.I'm generally not into superhero movies or series but this is different. Here the superheroes are more the villains than the heroes, making for a very interesting and original take on the genre. Throw in some very intriguing sub-plots involving the superheroes' private lives, the politics of their jobs and machinations within their team plus some profound observations and themes involving the (forced) superficiality of public figures, the intrusiveness and control of the media and the influence of social media status and you have a series that is original, entertaining and a mirror of the times.Action scenes are well done, with some great CGI and graphic grittiness - this is definitely not Disney! While mostly a drama there's some wonderfully funny moments too. Just about anything involving The Deep was always bound to raise a laugh.Not perfect though. The central plot - The Boys vs the superheroes - often appears clumsy and seems to go around in circles. It starts well enough but after a point, towards the end of Season 1, it just seems to get bogged down in endless escapades that have no point and occur based on the flimsiest of excuses. Plus these escapades often got resolved in silly, plot hole-riddled ways.The writers would have done better to initially concentrate on the internal machinations within The Seven with the superheroes vs The Boys plot starting as a sideshow and then amping it up as the series went on.Things do come together quite well in Season 3 though as the plot finds its focus. Season 3 is action-packed and intriguing with some great internal machinations within the superhero camp and a very interesting new character. It was heading for a fantastic showdown but the writers fluffed this somewhat in an effort to prolong the series. The final episode of S3 is a bit confusing and disappointing.All in all, it's highly entertaining viewing.Season ratings: S1&2 8/10, S3 9/10."

I bingewatch this and loved it.Review of Season Two:I was worried this one wouldn't match the first but it did. The story expands, the action and mayhem is ramped up, the new characters leave a real impression, and all of the good stuff from the first season is back. Looking forward to the third...Review of Season Three:I was a little worried about this third season when it first started. It felt like the freshness was gone to be replaced by the crudity and forced outrageousness that marred PREACHER. However, after a few episodes this finds its feet with the introduction of a great new character, some strong acting and all of the twists and political intrigue we know and love."

But the slow pace, so many flashbacks, so many side stories that divert from the main story. I lost my interest in the season. Only 3, 6 and 8 were the good ones in season 2Season 1- 9/10 Season 2- 7.5/10Now let's talk about season 3. What a return back to form. Crazy from the minute go. More violent, intense and gripping than seasons 1 and 2. The addition of the V24 and Jensen Ackles as soldier boy just adds to the fun. Although Ackles enters late, he takes the spotlight the minute he entersNow, the character development is the most interesting this season. Homelander is crazier than ever. Butcher and Hughie go down a dark path. Starlight taking a huge step against Vought (really, she had enough of them). The deep coming back into the game. A-Train coming to the realization what's it like to watch one's own get hurt. MM's past with soldier boy. Really interesting developmentBelow are the episodes in season 3 I found best to worst. There is no episode I found bad, it's just the ranking I found them most interestingHerogasm (without a doubt, the best episode)Glorious five year planThe instant white hot wild (yeah, a bit rushed, but definitely not bad as everyone says it is)The only man in the sky (the ending of this episode, Oh My God!)The last time to look on this world of liesHere comes a candle to light you to bedBarbary coastPaybackComing to the performances. Antony Starr went to another level this time. This guy really deserves an emmy for this role. Karl Urban, as delicious as ever, bringing his unique style of saying sarcastic lines. Amazing. Jack Quaid got some really good scenes to shine this season and he did. Erin Moriarty proved why she will always remain the best choice to play starlight. Laz Alonso had the emotional part this season, I think he handled it well.Always lovely to hear Tomer Capon's French in every season. He doesn't disappoint. Karen Fukuhara really dominates the action scenes. She's a boss! Ackles's Soldier Boy appears late and takes the center stage in the second half. His deep voice really supports in making us believe that he is a force to be reckoned with. Cameron Covetti doesn't get much to do except the last episode. Same goes for Chace Crawford. Jessie T Usher didn't get much screen time to perform what he had to. Others do well in their partsSo. Final word, I thought season 2 was bad and it got me to lost interest in the boys and wasn't really excited to watch season 3 but I decided to give it a try and thank god I did. Just amazing. Without a doubt, the best season for me out of the trioSeason 3- 9.5/10."

      "content": "There have been other shows and movies which have tried to give us a realistic take on superheroes but none of them do it as well as \"The Boys\" does. The Show is dark, violent, gritty and sometimes even humorous. It doesn't pull any punches especially with the amount of violence being displayed. I personally think the shows biggest achievement is bringing in politics and somehow not making it seem forced like most of the shows do nowadays. The Characters are extremely well written and the show has one of the greatest protagonist-antagonist dynamics I have ever seen.Last but not least, take a bow Anthony Starr. Anthony Starr puts on a terrifying and sometimes a downright disturbing performance as Homelander which is what the character demands. No one else could have played Homelander like he did. In fact the show wouldn't have even 50 percent as good without him. Hats off to him. Homelander will go down as one of the greatest antagonists of all time."

It follows a rag-tag group of \"boys\" who are out for revenge against a corporation of corrupted superheroes.The violence is gory and unexpected. The visuals are stunning. The writing, direction and acting are absolutely unnerving and phenomenal. You'll be on your edge of your seat during some scenes involving certain characters like Homelander and Butcher who keep you being unable to guess what their next move will be.The soundtrack is pretty awesome too, I found myself Shazzaming certain songs and to this day still listen to them. Can't wait for the next season."

      "content": "Fantastic show. Reminds me of the spirit of Watchmen. My only problem was the accents, firstly, Simon Pegg, jeez did he ever pay to get a part. Abysmal US accent. Butcher's accent slips all over the place too, thankfully he nails it most of the time. (Source: I'm British)For those who think it's 'too woke', it's not, it's neutral and satires extremes. Extreme corporatism hijacking social movements to protect their bottom line for example.Season 3 slipped a bit, but that's okay because they have to go off-piste a bit compared to the source material.Anyways if you liked this you'll like Watchmen, both the movie and the series. I don't enjoy most superhero films, because they always leave out the issues protested in this show. Would recommend. Be warned there are some very graphic scenes, for those of a milder disposition."
