He even - temporarily - gives up the Nag's Head for a trendy wine bar where he is just a little too casual for his own good. Rodney goes on a computer course and meets a nice girl called Cassandra. When she offers him a lift home, he is ashamed to tell her where he lives and gets her to drop him off in an upmarket suburban avenue. She eventually rumbles his deception, but agrees to go on a date anyway.",
