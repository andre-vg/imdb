In August 2022, the series was renewed for a second season.\r\nPremise\r\nThe Rehearsal features Nathan Fielder helping ordinary people rehearse difficult conversations or life events through the use of sets and actors hired to recreate real situations. The situations can be trivial, like confessing to a lie about educational history, or more complex, like raising a child. Fielder commissions extravagant sets with every detail recreated. He hires actors to inhabit these sets and practice different dialogue trees with his clients dozens of times. Information used to train the actors and build the sets is often collected without the subjects' knowledge.\r\nProduction\r\nThe premise for The Rehearsal grew out of Fielder's series Nathan for You. In preparation for the earlier series, Fielder and his team would role-play scenarios to predict how real people would react to his ridiculous suggestions, an exercise that often proved inaccurate. Fielder was inspired by the futility of the human impulse to control one's own future, which he found to be \"really funny.\"\r\nSome of the humor in The Rehearsal is derived from its extravagant sets. In the first episode, Fielder constructs a perfect duplicate of the bar in which the subject's difficult conversation is to take place.

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 96% approval rating with an average rating of 9.4/10, based on 54 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The Rehearsal gives Nathan Fielder carte blanche to take his absurdist comedy to the limit, which he pushes even further past with deadpan aplomb in what might be his most uncomfortably funny feat yet.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 86 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nIn The New York Times Critic's Pick review, James Poniewozik wrote, \"the show has a philosophical core: Is it ever possible to truly understand another person? And there's a tender, even beautiful side to its surreal moments.\" The Rehearsal has been compared to the work of Charlie Kaufman in Synecdoche, New York and the Tom McCarthy novel Remainder. The show has been described as a spiritual successor to Nathan For You, since both shows share a premise of Fielder helping average people in humorous ways. Vulture described Fielder's \"willingness to screw with people\" to put them in situations that might embarrass them or cause them to do things that are out of character being the core thread of his work.\r\nThe Rehearsal appeared in the top ten on numerous publications' \"Best of 2022\" lists, including first for Far Out, IndieWire, The Ringer, and ScreenCrush, among others.\r\nAccolades",

Feeling insecure about his own performance, Nathan reenacts the class with actors and a fake Nathan as the teacher while the real Nathan plays the role of Thomas, a student. Nathan makes his students immerse themselves in other people's lives while he immerses himself in Thomas's life, even living in Thomas's home. Nathan returns to Oregon, where his \"son\", Adam, is now a teenager. Nathan and Joshua, the actor playing Adam, decide that Adam should lash out due to resentment of his absentee father and develop a drug problem, a situation that mirrors Angela's own past. Adam suffers an overdose and is tended to by emergency responders played by Thomas and another Fielder Method graduate.

Seeking solace outside the house, Nathan opens his replica Alligator Lounge to the public under the name Nate's Lizard Lounge. The co-parents argue over a comedy skit featuring six-year-old Adam as \"Dr. Fart\" and a joke about eating feces, which Angela claims is a Satanic practice. Nathan rehearses the confrontations with a fake Angela, and in one scenario, she harshly criticizes Nathan's emotional detachment and questions the ethics of the entire production. However, in their real final confrontation, Angela simply decides to quit the rehearsal.

Remy's mother explains that her son might have trouble understanding the difference between acting and reality. To discover what went wrong, Nathan repeats Remy's scenes with different actors including Liam (a nine-year-old Adam actor), an adult actor, and a mannequin. He then explores what might have happened if Angela had stayed with him and meets with the real Angela, who urges him to forgive himself, as her religious beliefs state. In an attempt to truly understand the connection between parent and child, Nathan stages a new scenario in which he is Remy's mother Amber and Liam portrays Remy. They re-create the experience of appearing on <i>The Rehearsal</i> and becoming attached to \"pretend daddy\" Nathan. After coming to the emotional realization that they should not have done the show, Nathan as Amber seemingly breaks character and tells the fake Remy, \"I'm your dad.\"</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical response</h4><p>The series has received critical acclaim, with some praising it as one of the best new series of 2022.

The show has been described as a spiritual successor to Nathan For You, since both shows share a premise of Fielder helping average people in humorous ways. Vulture described Fielder's \"willingness to screw with people\" to put them in situations that might embarrass them or cause them to do things that are out of character being the core thread of his work.</p><p>The Rehearsal appeared in the top ten on numerous publications' \"Best of 2022\" lists, including first for Far Out, IndieWire, The Ringer, and ScreenCrush, among others.</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><caption><style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1152813436\">.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px;white-space:nowrap}</style><span class=\"sr-only\">Accolades received by The Rehearsal</span></caption><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Year</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"Reference\">Ref.</abbr></th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\"><span>Cinema Eye Honors</span></th><td><span>2022</span></td><td>Heterodox Award</td><td>Nathan Fielder</td><td style=\"background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2 notheme\">Nominated</td><td></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\"><span>Independent Spirit Awards</span></th><td><span>2023</span></td><td>Best New Non-Scripted or Documentary Series</td><td>Nathan Fielder, Dave Paige, Dan McManus, Christie Smith, Carrie Kemper, and Eric Notarnicola</td><td style=\"background: #9EFF9E; color: #000; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"yes table-yes2 notheme\">Won</td><td></td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\"><span class=\"mw-redirect\">Gotham Independent Film Awards</span></th><td><span>2022</span></td><td><span>Breakthrough Nonfiction Series</span></td><td>Nathan Fielder, Dave Paige, Dan McManus, and Christie Smith</td><td style=\"background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2 notheme\">Nominated</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>"
