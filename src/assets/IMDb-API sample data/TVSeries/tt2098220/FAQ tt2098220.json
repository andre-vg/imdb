      "question": "What is the difference between \"Hunter x Hunter (1999)\" and \"Hunter x Hunter (2011)\" ?",
      "answer": "Both series are anime based on the Japanese manga \"Hunter x Hunter\".The original series that aired in 1999 was produced by Nippon Animation, and while it did follow the manga for the most part, it also deviated in many ways. Parts of the original story were altered, as well as \"filler\" episodes, which are unique to the anime and not found anywhere in the manga. Unfortunately, the writing of the manga went on hiatus during the production of this series, and as a result, the 1999 series could not complete the Hunter x Hunter story.The 2011 series is produced by Madhouse Inc., and promises to follow the manga very closely. The manga has sinced resumed from hiatus, which should allow the 2011 series to animate episodes far beyond the 1999 series as well as the other Hunter x Hunter OVAs (Original Video Animations)."
