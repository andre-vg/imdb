All my friends and family members love it. I adore this sitcom from my heart.It's sad to see though that the series is lost and the producers had promised season 2 but that was 5 years ago! This is a lost classic and begs to be released on DVD. If you want, it's available on Youtube. But still it requires a proper tribute.I really hope that in the next 10-20 years people will recognize this sitcom and do something about it. Because it's just too much fun and joys are plentiful. Hats Off to the entire team!!!!"

      "title": "CULT CLASSIC",
      "content": "I remember being blown away while watching 'Sarabhai vs Sarabhai' when it first aired in 2004. It was unlike anything on Indian television at the time. A trailblazer, different from the usual saas-bahu dramas. Even in terms of sitcoms, It was completely different. Refreshing, intelligent, witty and funny. It was addictive to watch. I fell in love with it immediately, right from the first episode. The writing ruled and the terrific cast just elevated it to another level. The main characters trademark quirks, be it Indravardhan's pranks or Maya's elegance or Monisha's craziness or Rosesh's poetry or Sahil's frustration, elevate normal-mundane situations to insane and out-of-control situations. Add to it the bonkers supporting characters and their quirks, Dushyant's helpfulness (ahem!) or Madhu-kaka's slight deafness (ahem!ahem!) added a whole level of insanity to the already insane situation. Creating plenty of laughs and making it one of the best shows of Indian Television. It was the perfect cocktail of great writing, smart directing and brilliant acting. No other show has been able to achieve this level of perfection. I watched it again recently and could reconnect with it immediately. It is as relevant in 2019 as it was in 2004. It has aged like fine wine. A Cult Classic for the ages."

The very funny attributes the characters of the show are infused with,along with the brilliantly written dialogues of the show all add to the immense popularity that the show garnered amongst the masses. Truly changed the face of Indian T.V. Sarabhai was a pathbreaker and a trendsetter in every respect.For every other shows that were aired after Sarabhai, it was difficult to follow fashion and match up to the standards set by Sarabhai vs Sarabhai. I wonder how many of them managed to surpass this. Extremely delighted that the DVD's have released."

And the best thing in the show was Rosesh's KILLER Poetry. So irritating yet so enjoyable:)Too bad that we do not have another season coming! I still hope a new season starts someday."

      "content": "I started watching this series about 10 days back. I liked it so much that I finished the entire season in just 10 days. It is one of the best sitcoms I have ever seen in my life. It offers a unique combination of slapstick and subtle \"sophisticated\" humor.The characters of this series are unique and are instantly likable. Only after 1 episode, you are able to form a bond with them and understand the situation from their perspective. The acting is top notch. I would specially like to praise the choice of cast. No one else would have done a better job in their respective roles.Satish Shah is just so immensely comic. Ratna Pathak gives a splendid performance, perhaps the best of the lot. Roopali Ganguly is sweet, innocent and bubbly and Sumeet Raghavan is mature and rational. These are joined by Rajesh Kumar who I believe was the source of most of the humor in the series.The characters are constantly shown to be one dimensional. All of life's situations are characterized differently by each of them because of their characteristics and this generates intense humor. There's always friction between some family members but the latent love that they have for each other always prevails.The background score is just too good. The theme music when Maya starts to count the list of middle class things that Monisha does/like lifts the mood instantly. Even in crisis situations, the \"list\" of middle class things instantly makes you laugh and smile.I believe the show deserves every hype it gets. Because it always kept a big smile on my face. Even if there was no humor, I never stopped smiling.Recommended for everyone looking for light hearted but good comedy!!!"

The characters became so famous among the Indian audience that they made their way into pop culture- Maya Sarabhai and her rants about the Middle Class, Monisha Sarabhai and her budget-living ways, Indravadan Sarabhai's Naradmuni turn and Rosesh Sarabhai's terrible poems. In the midst of it all is Sahil Sarabhai, trying to live with this madness. The supporting characters like near-deaf Madhu Fufa and gadget-freak Dushyant are also endearing and hilarious. Each actor has done their roles complete justice.Complement that with the dialog and the story in each episode, and this show is near-perfect. I have watched the show multiple times and I know I will never tire of it. Indian TV needs more shows like this one."

It is famous amongst youngsters because they prefer witty, sarcastic punches which Satish Shah (Indravadan Sarabhai) delivers with such an ease. Intelligent jokes, which Sumeet Raghavan (Sahil Sarabhai) never fails to deliver. The silly comedy as depicted by Rupali Ganguly (Monisha Sarabhai) and Rajesh Kumar (Rosesh Sarabhai). And of course, the brilliant acting by Ratna Pathak Shah (Maya Sarabhai).The thing that stands out for me, is, that apart from the main cast, the supporting cast is equally funny and brilliant.Right from Madhusudhan Fufa's \"hain, hain?\", to Dushyant Sarabhai explaining each and every thing. Every character in this show has it's unique charm and is equally important. The script of each and every episode is really good. I never felt that any joke is being repeated, or is being over-used, even though I have watched each episode at least 5 time (NO! I am not exaggerating) It's one amongst those Hindi TV serials which can be said to match the level of shows like friends,two and a half men,big bang theory and how I met your mother in terms of sarcastic dialogs...Acting and intelligent humour.... I really hope they come up with it's second season already. It is time Indian television has had some intelligent comedy."

      "title": "The quintessential Indian family sitcom",
      "content": "A regaling Hindi sitcom and soap opera, Sarabhai v/s Sarabhai revolves around the daily lives of the quirky characters that make up the Sarabhai family.The show fares well at depicting a typical urban upper middle class Indian family in the early 2000s. It effectively captures the lifestyle and interpersonal dynamics as well as common attitudes and beliefs of that time. The characters span a wide range of natures - the genial prankster Indravadan, his domineering acerbic wife Maya, their straight man elder son Sahil and irresponsible daughter-in-law Monisha, and their younger son and mother's pet Rosesh form the core family. Along with witty wordplay and humorous dialogue, the comedy is also brought out by employing recurring gags such as Maya's contempt for the middle class, Monisha's miserliness and Rosesh's unappreciated attempts at poetry.However, it should be emphasized that Sarabhai v/s Sarabhai is unlikely to be appreciated by international audiences unfamiliar with the Indian setting and culture. There is also a dire lack of character progression; the family members never change or develop significantly as a result of their experiences, instead remaining one-note personalities. Events that should be treated with a modicum of seriousness are instead used solely for comedic effect. Romance subplots especially are extremely corny and work lives are barely featured. In general, the choice of independent episodic storylines prevents references to past happenings. There is a lot of overacting as well; this is even more evident in the needless Season 2. Finally, the sound effects that are played after each retort quickly become grating.Despite these criticisms, Sarabhai v/s Sarabhai is among the foremost Indian sitcoms. Even if incidents and personalities are exaggerated for dramatic effect, the stories nonetheless tend to be endearing and amusing. The show is best suited for Indian audiences and Indian diaspora abroad who will be better able to relate to the content and derive enjoyment from it."

Exp actor played one of the best role and joined legends with ease.Next is Roshesh , Rajesh Kumar. Outstadning performance. His combination with Ratna was great, and with Satish Shah was just hilarious. He added great flavor to show.Dushyant, Director Deven Bhojani was super enzyme to show. He was mind blowing with each act and with Satish, Rajesh and Ruplai , he added superb chemistry.Other actors, Vitthal , Raadhabai was also great.Show was bestest !!!"

Great thing is even if these gags are repeated multiple times it is written in such a beautiful manner that you will never be bored from it. in fact each time this will make you laugh.I have seen this show multiple time after it went off air on youtube and still watch them whenever feeling bored.I will recommend it to everyone to give it a try.

      "content": "This was my favourite hindi show after Dekh bhai Delhi and season 1 had me in splits.The chemistry of the cast and their dialogues is funny like hell. Missed the show when it was over and eagerly waited for the second season but hate hate hate the introduction of the new character jasmine.She couldn't keep up with the cast in terms of dialogue, comedy or acting. Every time she is on scene it breaks the organic vibe of the original cast. Any scene with the original cast will have you laughing till you are in tears but it does not work at all with her.What a disappointing development. You can watch 70 episodes of season 1 without needing a break but I couldn't sit through even one episode with this jasmine character.If you want to experience the actual humour of the show, watch season 1 and skip the second."

      "content": "The best and smartest Indian comedy show till date. Season 1 was terrific, was in school when I watched it. Recently finished Season 2, it's simply too good. Bought back memories from my childhood watching all the cast come together. A big thanks to the cast for another season. New added characters also did a great job, Superb writing, amazing HUMOR. I would love to see another season, but doubt it will bear fruit."
