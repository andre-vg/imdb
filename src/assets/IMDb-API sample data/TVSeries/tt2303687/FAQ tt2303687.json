      "question": "What city is this supposed to take place in? Is it Birmingham? Or do they ever say?",
      "answer": "The story is set in Birmingham and some of the exteriors show that city, but the city's name is never mentioned in the script, and the script seems to give the impression of just a generic English city other than London. Since the series is produced in Northern Ireland, many of the exteriors are actually in Belfast and vicinity."
